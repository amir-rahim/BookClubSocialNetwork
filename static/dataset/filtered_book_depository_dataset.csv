In 1982 Russell E. Burrows, a treasure hunter in southern Illinois, stumbled on a cache of ancient weapons, jewels, and gold sarcophagi in a remote cave. There also were stone tablets inscribed with illustrations of Roman-like soldiers, Jews, early Christians, and West African sailors. These relics fueled a bitter controversy in the archaeological community regarding their authenticity, leading Burrows to destroy the entrance to the cave. Researching more than 7,000 artifacts removed from the cave before it was sealed, Frank Joseph explains how these objects came to be buried in the middle of the United States. It started with Cleopatra, whose daughter was made queen of the semi-independent realm of Mauretania, present-day Morocco, which she ruled with her husband, King Juba II. Following the execution of their son, Ptolemy, by Emperor Caligula, the Mauretanians rebelled against their Roman overlords and made their way into what is now Ghana. There they constructed a fleet of ships for a transatlantic voyage to a land where they hoped to rebuild their kingdom safe from Roman rule. They took with them a great prize unsuccessfully sought by two Roman emperors: Cleopatra's golden treasure and King Juba's encyclopedic library of ancient wisdom. Fully illustrated with many previously unpublished photographs of artifacts retrieved from the southern Illinois site, The Lost Treasure of King Juba is a compelling story that could force us to rethink the early history of our nation and the possibility that Africans arrived on our continent nearly fifteen centuries before Columbus.",152.0,222.0,19.0,,Original ed.,,1.0,9781591430063,,8bd94699beaa30e515baea727367e9aa,full/a/a/6/aa646ff875ec5a6c72eb0a598c8334eaa0bf3eb9.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5914/9781591430063.jpg,Bear & Company,,1591430062,9781591430063,en,2003-04-29 00:00:00,,3.76,25.0,The Lost Treasure of King Juba : The Evidence of Africans in America Before Columbus,/Lost-Treasure-King-Juba-Frank-Joseph/9781591430063,399.16

Instead of choosing them, Gould asks, why not opt for a golden mean that accords dignity and distinction to each realm? In his distinctively elegant style, Gould offers a lucid, contemporary principle that allows science and religion to coexist peacefully in a position of respectful noninterference. Science defines the natural world; religion our moral world in recognition of their separate spheres of influence. In exploring this thought-provoking concept, Gould delves into the history of science, sketching affecting portraits of scientists and moral leaders wrestling with matters of faith and reason. Stories of seminal figures such as Galileo, Darwin, and Thomas Henry Huxley make vivid his argument that individuals and cultures must cultivate both a life of the spirit and a life of rational inquiry in order to experience the fullness of being human.

Ever since Darwin, we've known that elegant things can emerge (indeed, self-organize) from ""simpler"" beginnings. And, says theoretical neurophysiologist William H. Calvin, the bootstrapping of new ideas works much like the immune response or the evolution of a new animal species,except that the brain can turn the Darwinian crank a lot faster, on the time scale of thought and action. Drawing on anthropology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and the neurosciences, Calvin also considers how a more intelligent brain developed using slow biological improvements over the last few million years. Long ago, evolving jack-of-all trades versatility was encouraged by abrupt climate changes. Now, evolving intelligence uses a nonbiological track: augmenting human intelligence and building intelligent machines.",137.0,203.0,12.45,,,,1.0,9780465072781,,0ba0d72d7245b373079b21c5a3f660d2,full/b/3/6/b36b0d452f69fae5e7c1ce36a1f8c4d77dd61052.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/4650/9780465072781.jpg,,,046507278X,9780465072781,en,1997-09-06 00:00:00,,3.54,194.0,"How Brains Think : Evolving Intelligence, Then And Now",/How-Brains-Think-William-H-Calvin/9780465072781,222.26

During the war, Germany- and, later, the Allies- plundered Europe's historic treasures. Between 1939 and 1945, German armed forces roamed from Dunkirk to Stalingrad, looting gold, silver, currency, paintings and other works of art, coins, religious artifacts, and millions of books and other documents. The value of these items, many of which were irreplaceable, is estimated in the billions of dollars. The artwork alone, looted under Hitler's direction, exceeded the combined collections of the Metropolitan Museum, the British Museum, and the Louvre. As the war wound to its conclusion in 1945, occupying forces continued the looting. The story of these celebrated works of art and other vanished treasures- and the mystery of where they went- is a remarkable tale of greed, fraud, deceit, and treachery.

All of these disciplines inform her writing, but none distract from the poetic story-telling or the mystical lore she encounters and then conveys. Her journey takes her to a churchyard with a fountain representing St. Bridget, perhaps a Christian representation of the Celtic goddess of water, fire, and transformation, called Brigit. Monaghan describes spiral petroglyphs and ancient sacred caves, bogs and woods where fairies have played their tricks on humans, and water falls that became sacred spots.

Now The Library of America presents an exclusive one-volume edition of this enduring masterwork by John Dos Passos, including for the first time detailed notes and a chronicle of the world events that serve as a backdrop. In the novels that make up the trilogy--The 42nd Parallel, 1919, and The Big Money--Dos Passos creates an unforgettable collective portrait of America, shot through with sardonic comedy and brilliant social observation. He interweaves the careers of his characters and the events of their time with a narrative verve and breathtaking technical skill that make U.S.A. among the most compulsively readable of modern classics. A startling range of experimental devices captures the textures and background noises of twentieth-century life: ""Newsreels"" with blaring headlines; autobiographical ""Camera Eye"" sections with poetic stream-of-consciousness; ""biographies"" evoking emblematic historical figures like J.P. Morgan, Henry Ford, John Reed, Frank Lloyd Wright, Thorstein Veblen, and the Unknown Soldier. Holding everything together is sheer storytelling power, tracing dozens of characters from the Spanish-American War to the onset of the Depression. The U.S.A. trilogy is filled with American speech: labor radicals and advertising executives, sailors and stenographers, interior decorators and movie stars. Their crisscrossing destinies take in wars and revolutions, desperate love affairs and harrowing family crises, corrupt public triumphs and private catastrophes, in settings that include the trenches of World War I, insurgent Mexico, Hollywood studios in the silent era, Wall Street boardrooms, and the tumultuous streets of Boston just before the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. The volume contains newly researched chronologies of Dos Passos's life and of world events cited in U.S.A., notes, and an essay on textual selection.

This Crusade was the Catholic Church's response to the rapid growth of a rival Christian religion in the very heart of Christendom - the religion of the Cathars (or 'pure ones'). These heretics drew their strength from the consciousness of belonging to a faith that had never seen eye to eye with Catholicism and was more ancient than the Church itself.

Drawing on firsthand reporting from war zones around the world, David Rieff shows us what aid workers do in the field and the growing gap between their noble ambitions and their actual capabilities for alleviating suffering. He describes how many humanitarian organizations have moved from their founding principle of neutrality, which gave them access to victims, to encouraging the international community to take action to stop civil wars and ethnic cleansing. By calling for intervention, humanitarian organizations risk being seen as taking sides in a conflict and thus jeopardizing their access to victims. And by overreaching, the humanitarian movement has allowed itself to be hijacked by the major powers.

If life once existed on Mars, might it have originated there and traveled to earth inside meteorites blasted into space by cosmic impacts?  Davies builds on recent scientific discoveries and theories to address larger questions of existence: What, exactly, is life? Is it the inevitable by-product of physical laws, as many scientists maintain, or an almost miraculous accident? Are we alone in the universe, or will life emerge on all earthlike planets? And if there is life elsewhere in the universe, is it preordained to evolve toward greater complexity and intelligence?

He wants to learn what happened in his native village over the long, terrible years of Fascism; perhaps, he even thinks, he will settle down. And yet as he uncovers a secret and savage history from the war--a tale of betrayal and reprisal, sex and death--he finds that the past still haunts the present. The Moon and the Bonfires is a novel of intense lyricism and tragic import, a masterpiece of twentieth-century literature that has been unavailable to American readers for close to fifty years.

To console his only child, Daniel's widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona's guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel's father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax's work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona's darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn't find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.",164.59,243.33,38.35,,,,2.0,9781594200106,,4e92112e28af603afb5bda9aa6954cce,full/8/b/0/8b05d8abfc28eb655ff8c24e29a2a7564c52330d.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5942/9781594200106.jpg,,,1594200106,9781594200106,en,2004-04-12 00:00:00,,4.27,477185.0,The Shadow of the Wind,/Shadow-Wind-Carlos-Ruiz-Zafon/9781594200106,766.57

But in 1954 a local fisherman is found suspiciously drowned, and a Japanese American named Kabuo Miyamoto is charged with his murder. In the course of the ensuing trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake is more than a man's guilt. For on San Pedro, memory grows as thickly as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries--memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched. Gripping, tragic, and densely atmospheric, Snow Falling on Cedars is a masterpiece of suspense-- one that leaves us shaken and changed. ""Haunting....

The 21st century, once greeted triumphantly as marking the dawn of a worldwide neo-liberal civilization, suddenly became menaced. The choice presented from the White House and its supporters was to stand shoulder-to-shoulder against terrorism or be damned.

Some of this has been the direct responsibility of the United States and Russia.

His documentary about a squad of U.S. troops, ""The World of Charlie Company,"" received every major award for broadcast journalism. Despite the professional acclaim, however, the traumatic stories Laurence covered became a personal burden that he carried long after the war was over.

Zecharia Sitchin's bestselling series The Earth Chronicles provided humanity's side of the story-as recorded on ancient clay tablets and other Sumerian artifacts--concerning our origins at the hands of the Anunnaki, ""those who from heaven to earth came."" In The Lost Book of Enki, we can view this saga from a different perspective through this richly conceived autobiographical account of Lord Enki, an Anunnaki god, who tells the story of these extraterrestrials' arrival on Earth from the 12th planet Nibiru. The object of their colonization: gold to replenish the dying atmosphere of their home planet. Finding this precious metal results in the Anunnaki creation of homo sapiens--the human race--to mine this important resource. In his previous works, Sitchin compiled the complete story of the Anunnaki's impact on human civilization in peacetime and in war from the fragments scattered throughout Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Egyptian, Canaanite, and Hebrew sources--the myths of all ancient peoples in the old world as well as the new. Missing from these accounts, however, was the perspective of the Anunnaki themselves. What was life like on their own planet? What motives propelled them to settle on Earth-and what drove them from their new home? Convinced of the existence of a now lost book that formed the basis of ancient Sumerian texts holding the answers to these questions, the author began his search for evidence. Through exhaustive research of primary sources, he has here re-created tales as the memoirs of Enki, the leader of these first astronauts. What takes shape is the story of a world of mounting tensions, deep rivalries, and sophisticated scientific knowledge that is only today being confirmed. An epic tale of gods and men unfolds, challenging every assumption we hold about our creation, our past, and our future.",152.0,229.0,19.0,,,,2.0,9781879181830,,24b4dcca7704c6673640787bf7b4c8f7,full/e/2/a/e2ac58077a491cc61596147479dc456118541b4d.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8791/9781879181830.jpg,Bear & Company,,1879181835,9781879181830,en,2002-01-31 00:00:00,,4.14,1216.0,The Lost Book of Enki : Memoirs and Prophecies of an Extraterrestrial God,/Lost-Book-Enki-Zecharia-Sitchin/9781879181830,612.35

Based on several months of research and an extended visit to the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the early 1990s (where he conducted over 100 interviews with Palestinians and Jews), Palestine was the first major comics work of political and historical nonfiction by Sacco, whose name has since become synonymous with this graphic form of New Journalism. Like Safe Area Gorazde, Palestine has been favorably compared to Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus for its ability to brilliantly navigate such socially and politically sensitive subject matter within the confines of the comic book medium. Sacco has often been called the first comic book journalist, and he is certainly the best.

Ralph Sawyer, an outstanding Western scholar of ancient Chinese warfare and a successful businessman in his own right, places this classic work of strategy in its proper historical context. Sawyer supplies a portrait of Sun-tzu's era and outlines several battles of the period that may have either influenced Sun-tzu or been conducted by him.

An invitation for every woman who feels she isn't godly enough... isn't loving enough... isn't doing enough. The life of a woman today isn't really all that different from that of Mary and Martha in the New Testament. Like Mary, you long to sit at the Lord's feet... but the daily demands of a busy world just won't leave you alone. Like Martha, you love Jesus and really want to serve him... yet you struggle with weariness, resentment, and feelings of inadequacy.  Then comes Jesus, right into the midst of your busy Mary/Martha life-and he extends the same invitation he issued long ago to the two sisters of Bethany. Tenderly he invites you to choose the better part-a joyful life of living-room intimacy with him that flows naturally into kitchen service for him.  How can you make that choice? With her fresh approach to the familiar Bible story and its creative, practical strategies, Joanna shows how all of us -Marys and Marthas alike- can draw closer to our Lord, deepening our devotion, strengthening our service, and doing both with less stress and greater joy.

Slim, blond, stylish, Faith has a life many would envy. Overcoming a childhood marked by tragedy, married to a successful investment banker and having raised two grown daughters, Faith has enjoyed her role as mother and wife, and the good life that emanates from their bustling Manhattan town house. But every step of the way, Faith has carried within her a secret she could divulge to no one. And with it, she has kept an even more painful secret from herself.  For Faith, it is the sudden death of her stepfather--a man who, like her husband, Alex, always remained just beyond her reach--that will touch off a journey of change and revelation. At the funeral, painful memories flood back--and an old friend reenters Faith's life. Faith is greeting mourners, when she hears a voice behind her and a single word that brings a quick smile to her face: ""Fred."" Only one person aside from her older brother, Jack, called her that. Brad Patterson was Jack's best friend, a long, lanky boy who teased, tormented, and protected Faith when they fancied themselves ""The Three Musketeers"" as kids. When Jack died years later, Faith and Brad came together again in their common, inconsolable grief, then lost touch once more amid the demands of families and busy lives a continent apart.  Now a lawyer in California, Brad has reentered Faith's life just as she is making a decision that plunges her marriage into crisis. Determined to fulfill a long-held desire for a career of her own, Faith applies to law school against her husband's wishes, igniting a barrage of anger and recrimination. Faith's only solace is the correspondence she has begun with Brad, a man trapped in an empty marriage of his own, a friend she once lost and has found again. Soon e-mails are flying between them, bridging three thousand miles, sharing much-needed friendship, support, laughter. And as these two childhood friends rediscover each other, something extraordinary is beginning to happen. In the safety of their friendship, Brad will find the courage to make a decision he should have made years before. And Faith, too, is changing, beginning to believe in herself--and in her right to grab hold of her dreams. Gathering a strength she never knew she had, Faith is finally ready to face the most painful step of all: of sharing the secret that has long been haunting her, and truly opening up her heart for the first time in her life.

A trip to Europe with her parents does little to raise her spirits, until she meets William, Duke of Whitfield. In time, despite her qualms, William insists on giving up his distant right to the British throne to make Sarah his dutchess and his wife. On their honeymoon, the newlyweds buy an old French chateau, but not long after, the war begins. William joins the allied forces, leaving Sarah, their first child, an infant, and their second child on the way, in France. After the Nazi forces take over the chateau, Sarah continues to survive the terror and deprivation of the Occupation, unwavering in her belief that her missing-in-action husband is still alive. After the war, as a gesture of goodwill, the Whitfields start buying jewels offered for sale by impoverished war survivors.

The Kiss is at once a moving testament to the fragility of life and a breathtaking story about the power of love to heal, to free, to transform, and to make broken spirits whole. On a warm June evening, a red double-decker bus, full of pasengers, speeds down a London street. A few blocks away, a man and a woman climb into a limousine, reveling in a magical evening of dancing and champagne. As their driver pulls into an intersection, the couple shares their first, searching kiss. For a moment, etched in time, all stands still--until, in a flash of metal and glass, their limousine is struck at full speed, crushed under the bus's tremendous weight. And a long journey begins--toward healing, toward hope, toward dreams of an infinite future... Isabelle Forrester is the exquisite wife of a prominent Parisian banker who has long since shut her out of his heart. For lonely years, Isabelle has lived a life of isolation, pouring her passions into caring for her desperately ill son, Teddy, and into making their Paris home as happy as possible for her teenage daughter, Sophie. Isabelle allows herself one secret pleasure: a long-distance friendship by telephone with an American man, a Washington power broker who travels in the highest circles of politics and who, like Isabelle, is trapped in an empty marriage. To Bill Robinson, Isabelle is a godsend, a woman of extraordinary beauty and intellectual curiosity--a kindred spirit who touches him across the miles with her warmth and gentle empathy. Their relationship is a gift, a lifeline that sustains them both through the heartache of marriages they cannot leave and will not betray. Agreeing to meet for a few precious, innocent days in London, Isabelle and Bill find their friendship changing. Then, amidst the sudden crash of steel against steel, they are thrust onto a new path, a path fraught with pain but also with possibility. Now, inside the cool, sterile wards of a London hospital, Isabelle and Bill cling to life, their bodies shattered almost beyond repair. In the days and weeks that follow, they slowly, painfully traverse a road to recovery littered with challenges of the body, spirit, and heart. Together, they must find the strength not only to embrace life again but to face what they have left behind. For Isabell, a loveless marriage turns into a brutal power struggle. For Bill, a time of healing exposes wounds that cut deeper than steel and realities that will test him to his core. For both, a tangle of changing relationships and the tragedy of another loss conspire to separate them once again. And this time they could lose each other forever. In a novel that is as compelling as it is compassionate, Danielle Steel weaves a story of courage in the face of unimaginable loss. With the grace of a master storyteller, she explores the strength it takes to conquer our greatest fears, showing us how the toughest choices can yield the most unexpected rewards...and how the longest, most winding journeys can begin with a single kiss.",107.0,179.0,30.0,,,,1.0,9780440236696,,6050b6dd729d0d069a89ac098d3ca606,full/9/8/b/98b653dd8d383088497d2d2d2a96bb9d1fdf5e15.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/4402/9780440236696.jpg,Random House Inc,,044023669X,9780440236696,en,2002-10-01 00:00:00,,3.81,6310.0,The Kiss,/Kiss-Danielle-Steel/9780440236696,213.0

Drawing on her decades of work with troubled youth and her wide experience with conflict resolution and reconciliatory justice, bestselling parenting educator Barbara Coloroso offers a practical and compassionate book destined to become a groundbreaking guide to this escalating problem. Coloroso helps readers recognize the characteristic triad of bullying: the bully who perpetrates the harm; the bullied who is the target (and who may become a bully); and the bystander––peers, siblings, or adults who don't act to defuse the situation. Readers learn: o What bullying is and what it isn't; the three kinds of bullying; and the differences and similarities between boy and girl bullies o How to read the subtle clues that a child is being bullied o Seven steps to take if your child is a bully o Four abilities that protect your child from succumbing to a bully o Why zero tolerance policies can equal zero thinking o Why contempt, not anger, drives bullying, and how to confront this in bullies. o o Bullying is a widespread problem. In a 2001 study by the Kaiser Foundation in conjunction with Nickelodeon TV network and Children Now, 86% of children ages 12–15 interviewed said they get teased or bullied at school––making bullying more prevalent than smoking, alcohol, drugs, or sex among the same age group.

Morris begins by discussing various ideas about the ultimate destiny of the universe: whether it will continue expanding or eventually collapse.

Wilson has scrutinized animals in their natural settings, tweezing out the dynamics of their social organization, their relationship with their environments, and their behavior, not only for what it tells us about the animals themselves, but for what it can tell us about human nature and our own behavior. He has brought the fascinating and sometimes surprising results of these studies to general readers through a remarkable collection of books, including The Diversity of Life, The Ants, On Human Nature, and Sociobiology. The grace and precision with which he writes of seemingly complex topics has earned him two Pulitzer prizes, and the admiration of scientists and general readers around the world.In Search of Nature presents for the first time a collection of the seminal short writings of Edward O. Wilson, addressing in brief and eminently readable form the themes that have actively engaged this remarkable intellect throughout his career.The central theme of the essays is that wild nature and human nature are closely interwoven. I argue that the only way to make complete sense of either is by examining both closely and together as products of evolution.... Human behavior is seen not just as the product of recorded history, ten thousand years recent, but of deep history, the combined genetic and cultural changes that created humanity over hundreds of thousands of years. We need this longer view, I believe, not only to understand our species, but more firmly to secure its future.The book is composed of three sections. Animal Nature, Human Nature ranges from serpents to sharks to sociality in ants. It asks how and whythe universal aversion to snakes might have evolved in humans and primates, marvels at the diversity of the world's 350 species of shark and how their adaptive success has affected our conception of the world, and admonishes us to be careful of little lives-to see in the construction of insect social systems another grand experiment in evolution for our delectation.The Patterns of Nature probes at the foundation of sociobiology, asking what is the underlying genetic basis of social behavior, and what that means for the future of the human species. Beginning with altruism and aggression, the two poles of behavior, these essays describe how science, like art, adds new information to the accumulated wisdom, establishing new patterns of explanation and inquiry. In The Bird of Paradise: The Hunter and the Poet, the analytic and synthetic impulses-exemplified in the sciences and the humanities-are called upon to give full definition to the human prospect.Nature's Abundance celebrates biodiversity, explaining its fundamental importance to the continued existence of humanity. From The Little Things That Run the World-invertebrate species that make life possible for everyone and everything else-to the emergent belief of many scientists in the human species' possible innate affinity for other living things, known as biophilia, Wilson sets forth clear and compelling reasons why humans should concern themselves with species loss. Is Humanity Suicidal? compares the environmentalist's view with that of the exemptionalist, who holds that since humankind is transcendent in intelligence and spirit, our species must have been released from the iron laws of ecology that bind allother species. Not without optimism, Wilson concludes that we are smart enough and have time enough to avoid an environmental catastrophe of civilization-threatening dimensions-if we are willing both to redirect our science and technology and to reconsider our self-image as a species.In Search of Nature is a lively and accessible introduction to the writings of one of the most brilliant scientists of the 20th century.

Nevertheless, the whiskers around their beaks and an apparent smile make crows, in a scruffy sort of way, endearingly 'human'.

For nearly a year and a half, they struggled to stay alive. As all hope of rescue faded, they realized their best chance of survival might be to set out on foot, across hundreds of miles of desolate ice, with their lifeboats dragged behind them on sledges, in hope of reaching safety. Twenty of them chose to stay aboard; thirteen began the trek; of them all, only two survived. Originally published in Russia in 1917, In the Land of White Death was translated into English for the first time by the Modern Library to widespread critical acclaim. As well as recounting Albanov's vivid, first-person account of his ninety-day ordeal over 235 miles of frozen sea, this expanded paperback edition contains three newly discovered photographs and an extensive new Epilogue by David Roberts based on the never-before-published diary of Albanov's only fellow survivor, Alexander Konrad. As gripping as Albanov's own tale, the Epilogue sheds new light on the tragic events of 1912-1914, brings to life many of those who perished (including the infamous captain Brusilov and nurse Zhdanko, the only woman on board), and, inadvertently, reveals one new piece of information--about the identity of the traitors who left Albanov for dead--that is absolutely shocking.

Aspirin, the world's most widely used drug, is based on compounds originally extracted from the bark of a willow tree, and more than a quarter of medicines found on pharmacy shelves contain plant compounds. Now Western medicine, faced with health crises such as AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, has begun to look to the healing plants used by indigenous peoples to develop powerful new medicines. Nowhere is the search more promising than in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical forest, home to a quarter of all botanical species on this planet--as well as hundreds of Indian tribes whose medicinal plants have never been studied by Western scientists. In Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice, ethnobotanist Mark J. Plotkin recounts his travels and studies with some of the most powerful Amazonian shamans, who taught him the plant lore their tribes have spent thousands of years gleaning from the rain forest. For more than a decade, Dr. Plotkin raced against time to harvest and record new plants before the rain forests' fragile ecosystems succumb to overdevelopment--and before the Indians abandon their own culture and learning for the seductive appeal of Western material culture. Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice relates nine of the author's quests, taking the reader along on a wild odyssey as he participates in healing rituals; discovers the secret of curare, the lethal arrow poison that kills in minutes; tries the hallucinogenic snuff epena that enables the Indians to speak with their spirit world; and earns the respect and fellowship of the mysterious shamans as he proves that he shares both their endurance and their reverence for the rain forest.",129.0,198.0,17.27,,Reprint,,1.0,9780140129915,,b26719c4d50e225edec0ed6d5f1987e1,full/c/1/f/c1f467861d68683db3828a9cbcbbaa20762f2d3b.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/1401/9780140129915.jpg,,,014012991X,9780140129915,en,1994-08-25 00:00:00,,4.24,1629.0,Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice,/Tales-Shamans-Apprentice-Mark-J-Plotkin-Ph-D/9780140129915,240.4

It relates to the truth of numbers and magnitudes equally applicable to all sciences and arts. The book brings to light how great and true knowledge is born of intuition, quite different from modern Western method. The ancient Indian method and its secret techniques are examined and shown to be capable of solving various problems of mathematics. The universe we live in has a basic mathematical structure obeying the rules of mathematical measures and relations. All the subjects in mathematics--Multiplication, Division, Factorization, Equations, Calculus, Analytical Conics, etc.--are dealt with in forty chapters, vividly working out all problems, in the easiest ever method discovered so far. The work, forms a class by itself, which is the result of the intuitional visualization of fundamental mathematical truth and principles during the course of eight years of highly concentrated mental endeavour on the part of the author. The question naturally arises as to whether the Sutras which form the basic of this treastise exist anywhere in the Vedic literature as known to us. However, the subject is not to be approached from a factual standpoint but from the ideal standpoint, viz., as the Vedas are traditionally accepted in India as the repository of all knowledge. This approach entirely turns tables on all critics, for the authorship of Vedic mathematics then need not be laboriously searched in the texts as preserved from antiquity.

In A Sideways Look at Time, Jay Griffiths takes readers on an extraordinary tour of time as we have never seen it before. With this dazzling and defiant work, Griffiths introduces us to dimensions of time that are largely forgotten in our modern lives. She presents an infectious argument for other, more magical times, the diverse cycles of nature, of folktale or carnival, when time is unlimited and on our side. This is a book for those who suspect that there's more to time than clocks.

Theatre Works audience shortly after a successful revival in London's West End. The story revolves around Mel and Edna Edison, trapped by circumstance in an apartment on Second Avenue, New York City, in 1974. Add a cellular phone or two, and it's life in 2000. Simon takes a good look at apartment life, career and role reversals, a nervous breakdown, and the love, torture, care, or inertia that somehow keeps a couple in a relationship for many years. At points, it's laugh-out-loud funny; at other times, it offers sensitive insight into the human condition. Fast-moving dialog with nonstop Simon quips and jokes performed extremely well by two fine actors: who could ask for more?

In this classic work Alan Watts shows us that we are all somewhat blind to the greater reality of the world around us.  Our limited perception only allows us to sense isolated pieces of life and keeps us from fully understanding how those pieces go together, and from understanding our relationship to the universe and to our fellow human beings.  Most importantly, this perception keeps us from fully understanding ourselves.The Book sparkles with warmth and wisdom, brilliantly blending and synthesizing Eastern and Western thought.  This is the very essence of Alan Watts' philosophy, derived from his years of study and spiritual exploration.  The Book is a guide to life, a way to remove impediments to our spiritual vision so that we can experience greater harmony and fulfillment.

Two English people--Bobby, a civil servant with a guilty appetite for African boys, and Linda, a supercilious ""compound wife""--are driving back to their enclave after a stay in the capital. But in between lies the landscape of an unnamed country whose squalor and ethnic bloodletting suggest Idi Amin's Uganda. And the farther Naipaul's protagonists travel into it, the more they find themselves crossing the line that separates privileged outsiders from horrified victims. Alongside this Conradian tour de force are four incisive portraits of men seeking liberation far from home. By turns funny and terrifying, sorrowful and unsparing, In A Free State is Naipaul at his best.",124.0,212.0,15.0,,Vintage Intl,,1.0,9781400030552,,39730a3d228363f6d67d939c3e941991,full/0/a/a/0aa3e1891a953df0a27f1529cc023d0bbc2c45be.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/4000/9781400030552.jpg,,,1400030552,9781400030552,en,2002-02-12 00:00:00,,3.5,4076.0,In a Free State,/Free-State-V-S-Naipaul/9781400030552,195.0

The sisters are careful not to discuss their father's shocking illness in public or even on the phone. Party lines and eavesdropping are the norm on the fictional South Carolina barrier island of Kelsal, and the sisters know that their father's standing in the community as the Episcopal minister would be in danger if word got out.

The Beach, as Richard has come to learn, is the subject of a legend among young travelers in Asia: a lagoon hidden from the sea, with white sand and coral gardens, freshwater falls surrounded by jungle, plants untouched for a thousand years.

The Feast of Love is just that -- a sumptuous work of fiction about the thing that most distracts and delights us. In a re-imagined Midsummer Night's Dream,  men and women speak of and desire their ideal mates; parents seek out their lost children; adult children try to come to terms with their own parents and, in some cases, find new ones.  In vignettes both comic and sexy, the owner of a coffee shop recalls the day his first wife seemed to achieve a moment of simple perfection, while she remembers the women's softball game during which she was stricken by the beauty of the shortstop. A young couple spends hours at the coffee shop fueling the idea of their fierce love. A professor of philosophy, stopping by for a cup of coffee, makes a valiant attempt to explain what he knows to be the inexplicable workings of the human heart Their voices resonate with each other -- disparate people joined by the meanderings of love -- and come together in a tapestry that depicts the most irresistible arena of life.

Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collins's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins's other great mystery, The Moonstone,  has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: ""Author of The Woman in White.""",106.0,175.0,30.0,,Reissue,,1.0,9780553212631,,46b645ae7ae8d657d1591137ed650d29,full/9/3/2/932bd3649cc80d54b2943c96a963b0336e371e5d.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5532/9780553212631.jpg,Bantam Doubleday Dell,,055321263X,9780553212631,en,2003-08-01 00:00:00,,3.99,135118.0,The Woman in White,/Woman-White-Wilkie-Collins/9780553212631,269.0

Reviewers overwhelmingly agree that she is an important new voice in American fiction: hers is ""a bright debut that points to even brighter accomplishments to come"" (Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times), a tour de force that is ""poignant and varied, emotionally vivid and hauntingly melancholy"" (San Francisco Chronicle), and ""a Cuban odyssey that conjures up Eugene O'Neill-like drama"" (Kirkus Reviews).

Witty, stylish and evocative, Ice Cream is Helen Dunmore's astonishing new collection of stories, the first to be published in the United States. World-class storyteller Helen Dunmore explores friendship, regret and mysterious passions in stories crafted with subtlety, humor and a surprising tenderness.

In several stories a soulful, curious woman named Ulli takes up residence in the reader's imagination--stumbling across a strangely charismatic collector of religious icons, contemplating a youthful pregnancy, and remembering a troubled lover. In Ice Cream, Dunmore reveals both her poet's ear for the concise and piercing potentialities of language and the novelist's ambition of scope, proving her status as ""a master of the shorter form"" (The Sunday Telegraph).",128.52,183.39,15.24,,Reprint,,1.0,9780802140531,,c9e2768b4dee3d7c42534fd8ada07788,full/7/6/c/76c137e7850d98ffe353b79da15f858ccb3ecc2a.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8021/9780802140531.jpg,,,080214053X,9780802140531,en,2004-02-26 00:00:00,,3.61,193.0,Ice Cream,/Ice-Cream-Helen-Dunmore/9780802140531,222.26

One of the unique books of world literature, Swift's masterful satire describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, to surreal kingdoms inhabited by miniature people and giants, quack philosophers and scientists, horses endowed with reason and men who behave like beasts. Written with great wit and invention, Gulliver's Travels is a savage parody on man and his institutions that has captivated readers for nearly three centuries. As bestselling author and critic Allan Bloom observed: ""Gulliver's Travels is an amazing rhetorical achievement. Swift had not only the judgment with which to arrive at a reasoned view of the world but the fancy by means of which he could re-create that world in a form which teaches where argument fails and which satisfies all while misleading none."" This representative collection of Swift's major writings includes the complete Gulliver's Travels as well as A Tale of a Tub, ""The Battle of the Books,"" ""A Modest Proposal,"" ""An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity,"" ""The Bickerstaff Papers,"" and many more of his brilliantly satirical works.

There are stopovers in the Bahamas and England, and in New York, where that glossiest of magazines, Decorating Quarterly, reflects the cutting-edge trendiness of its editor, Camilla Jameson Porter. (Camilla has recently broken new ground in the world of power lunches by booking two tables on the same day, and shuttling between them, at the city's trendiest restaurant.) It is Camilla who has sent our hero, Andre Kelly, to Cap Ferrat to take glamorous photo-graphs of the houses and treasures of the rich, famous, and fatuous. He happens to have his camera at the ready when he spots a Cézanne being loaded onto a plumber's truck near the home of an absent collector. Odd, thinks Andre.

Written during the war, the story takes Marlowe out of the seamy L.A. streets to the deceptive tranquility of the surrounding mountains, as the search for a businessman's missing wife expands into an elegy of loneliness and loss. The darker tone typical of Chandler's later fiction is evident in The Little Sister (1949), in which an ambitious starlet, a blackmailer, and a seemingly naive young woman from Manhattan, Kansas, are the key players in a plot that provides fuel for a bitter indictment of Hollywood and Chandler's most savage portrayal of his adopted city. The Long Goodbye (1953), his most ambitious and self-revealing novel, uncovers a more anguished resonance in the Marlowe character, in a plot that hinges on the betrayal of friendship and the compromises of middle age. Playback (1958), written originally as a screenplay, is Chandler's seventh and last novel. A special feature of this volume is Chandler's long-unavailable screenplay for the film noir classic Double Indemnity (1944), adapted from James M. Cain's novel. Supplementing the volume, and providing a more personal glimpse of Chandler's personality, are a selection of essays - including ""The Simple Art of Murder, "" in which Chandler muses on his pulp roots and on the special qualities of his hero and style - and eleven letters that range wittily and often sardonically over the worlds of writing, publishing, and filmmaking.",1.0,1.0,1.0,,New,,2.0,9781883011086,,74858df01b937965b22bdbdbc23a67bb,full/1/a/1/1a14e17ef1f62d8494e709c701fdffcfc0e21cdb.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8830/9781883011086.jpg,,,1883011086,9781883011086,en,1995-10-01 00:00:00,,4.48,1139.0,Raymond Chandler : Later Novels and Other Writings (LOA #80),/Raymond-Chandler-Raymond-Chandler/9781883011086,671.32

Dr. Dane Logan, a former street waif who has been adopted by a doctor's family in Cheyenne, puts his lifelong dream to work filling this need. His renown as a surgeon spreads throughout the frontier, even while his love grows for the beautiful Tharyn, an orphan he lost contact with when he left New York City as a child. Will happiness in love ever come to Dane - or will the roving Tag Moran gang bring his hopes to a dark end? Showdown in Cheyenne  1880. The frontier is uneasy. Tag Moran and his vicious gang are roving the West, robbing banks and stagecoaches. Dr. Dane Logan, a former street waif adopted by a doctor's family in Cheyenne, is gaining renown for his delicate surgical skill. Dane's situation becomes precarious when an unfortunate death turns Tag into his bitter enemy. If outlaws come between the tall young surgeon and his childhood love, who'll be left to see another sunrise? Story Behind the Book Always planning ahead for what we will write for Multnomah Publishers, JoAnna and I decided to follow the ORPHAN TRAIN trilogy with one about a medical doctor in the Old West, so we came up with the idea of a trilogy called FRONTIER DOCTOR.

Le Guin For forty years, Colony 3245.12 has been Ofelia's home. On this planet far away in space and time from the world of her youth, she has lived and loved, weathered the death of her husband, raised her one surviving child, lovingly tended her garden, and grown placidly old. And it is here that she fully expects to finish out her days--until the shifting corporate fortunes of the Sims Bancorp Company dictates that Colony 3245.12 is to be disbanded, its residents shipped off, deep in cryo-sleep, to somewhere new and strange and not of their choosing. But while her fellow colonists grudgingly anticipate a difficult readjustment on some distant world, Ofelia savors the promise of a golden opportunity. Not starting over in the hurly-burly of a new community . . . but closing out her life in blissful solitude, in the place she has no intention of leaving. A population of one.  With everything she needs to sustain her, and her independent spirit to buoy her, Ofelia actually does start life over-for the first time on her own terms: free of the demands, the judgments, and the petty tyrannies of others. But when a reconnaissance ship returns to her idyllic domain, and its crew is mysteriously slaughtered, Ofelia realizes she is not the sole inhabitant of her paradise after all. And, when the inevitable time of first contact finally arrives, she will find her life changed yet again--in ways she could never have imagined. . . .

Here, collected for the first time in one volume, are all of his great writings about the many kinds of fishing he did--from trout in the rivers of northern Michigan to marlin in the Gulf Stream. In A Moveable Feast,  Hemingway speaks of sitting in a cafe in Paris and writing about what he knew best--and when it came time to stop, he ""did not want to leave the river."" The story was the unforgettable classic, ""Big Two-Hearted River,"" and from its first words we do not want to leave the river either. He also wrote articles for the Toronto Star on fishing in Canada and Europe and, later, articles for Esquire about his growing passion for big-game fishing. His last books, The Old Man and the Sea and Islands in the Stream,  celebrate his vast knowledge of the ocean and his affection for its great denizens. Hemingway on Fishing is an encompassing, diverse, and fascinating collection. From the early Nick Adams stories and the memorable chapters on fishing the Irati River in The Sun Also Rises to such late novels as Islands in the Stream,  this collection traces the evolution of a great writer's passion; the range of his interests; the sure use he made of fishing, transforming it into the stuff of great literature.

The eleven novels in The Library of America's adventurous two-volume collection taps deep roots in the American literary imagination, exploring themes of crime, guilt, deception, obsessive passion, murder, and the disintegrating psyche. With visionary and often subversive force they create a dark and violent mythology out of the most commonplace elements of modern life. James M. Cain's pioneering novel of murder and adultery along the California highway, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1934), shocked contemporaries with its laconic toughness and fierce sexuality. Horace McCoy's They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1935) uses truncated rhythms and a unique narrative structure to turn its account of a Hollywood dance marathon into an unforgettable evocation of social chaos and personal desperation. In Thieves Like Us (1937), Edward Anderson vividly brings to life the dusty roads and back-country hideouts where a fugitive band of Oklahoma outlaws plays out its destiny. The Big Clock (1946), an ingenious novel of pursuit and evasion by the poet Kenneth Fearing, is set by contrast in the dense and neurotic inner world of a giant publishing corporation under the thumb of a warped and ultimately murderous chief executive.

One fateful evening in a suitably dark, beer-soaked Swiss rathskeller, a wild and obscure Irishman named James Joyce would become the drinking partner of an unknown physics professor called Albert Einstein. And on that same momentous night, Sir John Babcock, a terror-stricken young Englishman, would rush through the tavern door bringing a mystery that only the two most brilliant minds of the century could solve . . . or perhaps bringing only a figment of his imagination born of the paranoia of our times.

[16274],47816.0,"[335, 336, 2617]","In a few years of extraordinary creative energy, Dashiell Hammett invented the modern American crime novel. In the words of Raymond Chandler, ""Hammett gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse. . . . He put these people down on paper as they were, and he made them talk and think in the language they customarily used for these purposes."" Beginning as a prolific contributor to the pulp magazines of the 1920s, he succeeded during his brief career in making his kind of crime fiction a crucial part of the fabric of American writing: a genre that did not evade reality but rather embodied the grittiness and harshness of modern urban life. The five novels that Hammett published between 1929 and 1934, collected here in one Library of America volume, have become part of modern American culture, creating archetypal characters and establishing the ground rules and characteristic tone for a whole tradition of hardboiled writing. Drawing on his own experiences as a Pinkerton detective, Hammett gave a harshly realistic edge to novels that were at the same time infused with a spirit of romantic adventure. His lean and deliberately simplified prose won admiration from such contemporaries as Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and William Faulkner. Each novel is distinct in mood and structure. Red Harvest (1929) epitomizes the violence and momentum of his Black Mask stories about the anonymous detective the Continental Op. In this raucous and nightmarish evocation of political corruption and gang warfare in a western mining town (modeled on Butte, Montana) nicknamed ""Poisonville,"" the Op takes Machiavellian pleasure in pitting one faction against another to bring about their mutual destruction. The Op returns in The Dain Curse (1929) to preside over a more ornately melodramatic tale involving jewel theft, drugs, and a mysterious religious cult. With The Maltese Falcon (1930) and its protagonist Sam Spade, Hammett achieved his most enduring popular success. A tightly constructed quest story with an unforgettable cast of eccentric adventurers, it is at the same time shot through with a sense of disillusionment and the arbitrariness of personal destiny.",135.89,207.01,31.5,,New,,2.0,9781883011673,,2bb508cb2b3fd4070006aa1cba655066,full/3/e/d/3ede2f349d16c15a09d6c12cd4b8bd8c28cb9101.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8830/9781883011673.jpg,,,1883011671,9781883011673,en,1999-10-01 00:00:00,,4.39,2036.0,Dashiell Hammett: Complete Novels,/Dashiell-Hammett-Complete-Novels-Dashiell-Hammett/9781883011673,635.03

The young Jedi Knight is in the care of Vergere, a fascinating creature of mystery and power, her intentions hard to fathom, her cruelties rarely concealed.

In the wrong hands, the tremendous energies of the Force can be devastating. And there are others watching Jacen's process closely, waiting patiently for the moment when he will be ready for their own dire purposes. Now, all is in shadows.

An old flame has moved into town under circumstances bound to raise suspicion. And that's just for starters. More evidence is gathering that can put Celia away for good. But attorney Jill Clark thinks the pieces of the puzzle fit together a bit too neatly. Either her client's Christian faith is a sham or she's the victim of a deadly frame-up--and the real killer is still afoot ... Shadow of Doubt is book two in the Newpointe 911 series by award-winning novelist Terri Blackstock. Newpointe 911 offers taut, superbly crafted novels of faith, fear, and close-knit small-town relationships, seasoned with romance and tempered by insights into the nature of relationships, redemption, and the human heart.

Lena Grove's resolute search for the father of her unborn child begets a rich, poignant, and ultimately hopeful story of perseverance in the face of mortality. It also acquaints us with several of Faulkner's most unforgettable characters, including the Reverend Gail Hightower, plagued by visions of Confederate horsemen, and Joe Christmas, a ragged, itinerant soul obsessed with his mixed-race ancestry. Powerfully entwining these characters' stories, Light in August brings to life Faulkner's imaginary South, one of literature's great invented landscapes, in all of its unerringly fascinating glory.

Like Chaim Potok, who revealed the Orthodox Jewish world from a young man's perspective in The Chosen, Abraham explores new ground, offering readers a tender story of a young Hasidic woman facing the challenges of growing up and the demands of her religion. Rachel Benjamin is the daughter of a quixotic rabbi who dreams of building a synagogue in the secluded upstate New York bungalow colony where his family now lives. As the rabbi's eldest daughter, Rachel is expected to set an example for her five siblings and for the other girls in the community: she must wear thick opaque tights with seams; she is forbidden to wear a bathing suit in public; and she can never read books in English. But like all young adults, Rachel bristles at the stringent rules set by her family and her religion, rebelling in ways that become increasingly apparent. Whether sneaking sheer nylons in and out of the house or applying for an illicit library card that will allow her access to the romance novels that she loves, Rachel is determined to do things her way. Dreaming of a life that mirrors that of the heroines in her favorite novels, Rachel craves the independence she will never have as a Hasidic woman in an arranged marriage. And yet, as her impending marriage draws inevitably nearer, the pulls of family and faith weigh against the frightening and unknown world beyond her own. This coming-of-age tale is both unusual and familiar--an intriguing, heartfelt look at the power of family and religion in the Hasidic community and the universal desire to leave the nest.",130.0,203.0,21.0,,Reprint,,1.0,9781573225489,,8cd0bca8ab91eb6e1de33acdddb156cd,full/c/8/7/c875a2803810063b07b214ae10c8af4ff95a4b4a.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5732/9781573225489.jpg,,,1573225487,9781573225489,en,1996-09-01 00:00:00,,3.57,1542.0,The Romance Reader,/Romance-Reader-Pearl-Abraham/9781573225489,254.0

Not only is it packing hurricane-force winds and up to five feet of snow, it's bringing something worse. Something even the islanders have never seen before. Something no one wants to see. Just as the first flakes begin to fall, Martha Clarendon, one of Little Tall Island's oldest residents, suffers an unspeakably violent death. While her blood dries, Andre Linoge, the man responsible sits calmly in Martha's easy chair holding his cane topped with a silver wolf's head...waiting. Linoge knows the townsfolk will come to arrest him. He will let them. For he has come to the island for one reason. And when he meets Constable Mike Anderson, his beautiful wife and child, and the rest of Little Tall's tight-knit community, this stranger will make one simple proposition to them all: ""If you give me what I want, I'll go away.""",156.0,235.0,28.0,Media tie-in,Media tie-in,,1.0,9780671032647,w. photos.,2bf65ee8e1703beb3459a27335ec2614,full/5/0/a/50a87c3320859492f3e845d24cd1c3f8f2ab26c6.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/6710/9780671032647.jpg,,,067103264X,9780671032647,en,1999-02-22 00:00:00,,3.94,20922.0,The Storm of the Century,/Storm-Century-Stephen-King/9780671032647,444.52

In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone.  Banker to the Poor  is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in ""putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long.""

It's a book to relish, to read and re-read. Unforgettable. --Salmon Rushdie An electrifying memoir from the acclaimed Nicaraguan writer (""A wonderfully free and original talent""--Harold Pinter) and central figure in the Sandinista Revolution.  Until her early twenties, Gioconda Belli inhabited an upper-class cocoon: sheltered from the poverty in Managua in a world of country clubs and debutante balls; educated abroad; early marriage and motherhood. But in 1970, everything changed. Her growing dissatisfaction with domestic life, and a blossoming awareness of the social inequities in Nicaragua, led her to join the Sandinistas, then a burgeoning but still hidden organization. She would be involved with them over the next twenty years at the highest, and often most dangerous, levels.  Her memoir is both a revelatory insider's account of the Revolution and a vivid, intensely felt story about coming of age under extraordinary circumstances. Belli writes with both striking lyricism and candor about her personal and political lives: about her family, her children, the men in her life; about her poetry; about the dichotomies between her birth-right and the life she chose for herself; about the failures and triumphs of the Revolution; about her current life, divided between California (with her American husband and their children) and Nicaragua; and about her sustained and sustaining passion for her country and its people.",132.0,201.0,23.0,,Anchor Books ed.,,1.0,9781400032167,"Illustrations, unspecified",24928e81b43e912e9cb4f68c1004b0c2,full/3/7/6/37648c8e524078b5575e697e88d205b140807132.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/4000/9781400032167.jpg,,,1400032164,9781400032167,en,2003-10-14 00:00:00,,4.21,2111.0,The Country Under My Skin : A Memoir of Love and War,/Country-Under-My-Skin-Gioconda-Belli/9781400032167,363.0

The book features interviews with some very interesting people: a dominatrix and her crossdressing husband; a crossdressing Reiki master and his son; a woman who after dating one crossdresser wanted to date others and fell in love with a transsexual instead; and a woman whose husband promised her he was only a crossdresser who later realized that he was transsexual.

Compiling some of Wilcock's most inspirational and life-transforming prophetic guidance from his channeled Source, this book conveys profound insights into topics such as earth changes, secret cabals, soul evolution, death and reincarnation, ascension, crop circles, and the theory of evolution. Explaining how energetic increases occurring in the Sun and planets can have scientifically-measurable, far-reaching effects in a number of realms, The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce presents new evidence that this energy can transform DNA, potentially making ESP, telekinesis, levitation, and other paranormal activities as common as breathing and usher in the Golden Age promised by every major spiritual tradition in human history.

A tale of the prairie land encountered by America's Swedish, Czech, Bohemian, and French immigrants, as well as a story of how the land challenged them, changed them, and, in some cases, defeated them, Cather's novel is a uniquely American epic. Alexandra Bergson, a young Swedish immigrant girl who inherits her father's farm and must transform it from raw prairie into a prosperous enterprise, is the first of Cather's great heroines--all of them women of strong will and an even stronger desire to overcome adversity and succeed. But the wild land itself is an equally important character in Cather's books, and her descriptions of it are so evocative, lush, and moving that they provoked writer Rebecca West to say of her: ""The most sensuous of writers, Willa Cather builds her imagined world almost as solidly as our five senses build the universe around us.""

Quoyle, a third-rate newspaper hack, with a ""head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair...features as bunched as kissed fingertips,"" is wrenched violently out of his workaday life when his two-timing wife meets her just desserts. An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle's Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family's unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above seventy degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it's easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the Gammy Bird (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph--in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets.

[287433],86310.0,[334],"The internationally renowned novel about the life and death of Jesus Christ. Hailed as a masterpiece by critics worldwide, The Last Temptation of Christ is a monumental reinterpretation of the Gospels that brilliantly fleshes out Christ's Passion. This literary rendering of the life of Jesus Christ has courted controversy since its publication by depicting a Christ far more human than the one seen in the Bible. He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other--subject to fear, doubt, and pain.  In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God's will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ's ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.

Her account of these nomadic hunter-gatherers, whose way of life had remained unchanged for thousands of years, is a ground-breaking work of anthropology, remarkable not only for its scholarship but for its novelistic grasp of character. On the basis of field trips in the 1980s, Thomas has now updated her book to show what happened to the Bushmen as the tide of industrial civilization--with its flotsam of property rights, wage labor, and alcohol--swept over them. The result is a powerful, elegiac look at an endangered culture as well as a provocative critique of our own. The charm of this book is that the author can so truly convey the strangeness of the desert life in which we perceive human traits as familiar as our own. . . .

""When I am asked about my Jewish affiliation, I define myself as a Hasid, "" writes the author. ""Hasid I was, Hasid I remain."" Yet Souls on Fire is not a simple chronological history of Hasidism, nor is it a comprehensive book on its subject. Rather, Elie Wiesel has captured the essence of Hasidism through tales, legends, parables, sayings, and deeply personal reflections. His book is a testimony, not a study. Hasidism is revealed from within and not analyzed from the outside. ""Listen attentively, "" Elie Wiesel's grandfather told him, ""and above all, remember that true tales are meant to be transmitted - to keep them to oneself is to betray them."" As a critic appearing on the front page of The New York Times Book Review has written, ""The judgment has been offered before: Elie Wiesel is one of the great writers of this generation."" Wiesel does not merely tell us, but draws, with the hand of a master, the portraits of the leaders of the movement that created a revolution in the Jewish world. Souls on Fire is a loving, personal affirmation of Judaism, written with words and with silence. The author brings his profound knowledge of the Bible, the Talmud, Kabbala, and the Hasidic tale and song to this masterpiece, showing us that Elie Wiesel is perhaps our generation's most fervid ""soul on fire.""",140.0,216.0,16.0,,Reissue,,1.0,9780671441715,black & white illustrations,433b956e95f0eaab2179fc8166aa300a,full/e/0/6/e06fa9d5afbe6bca49289ccc77ae9e8524b3297a.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/6714/9780671441715.jpg,POCKET BOOKS,,067144171X,9780671441715,en,1986-01-01 00:00:00,,4.19,544.0,Souls on Fire : Portraits and Legends of Hasidic Masters,/Souls-on-Fire-Elie-Wiesel/9780671441715,369.0

Entrenched on the same land since the early 1800s, the Howlands have, for seven generations, been pillars of their Southern community. Extraordinary family lore has been passed down to Abigail Howland, but not all of it.

Historically there have been few options available for individuals seeking help for treatment-resistant loved ones suffering from substance abuse. Co-author Dr. Robert Meyers spent ten years developing a treatment program that helps concerned significant others improve the quality of their lives and learn how to make treatment an attractive option for their partners who are substance abusers. Get Your Loved One Sober describes this multi-faceted program that uses supportive, non-confrontational methods to engage substance abusers into treatment. Called Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), the program uses scientifically validated behavioral principles to reduce the loved one's substance use and to encourage him or her to seek treatment.

In prose that blends the vernacular and the incantatory, the local and the mythic, these five works chart Steinbeck's evolution into one of the greatest and most enduring popular of American novelists.  The Pastures of Heaven (1932), a collection of interrelated stories, delineates the troubled inner lives and sometimes disastrous fates of families living in a seemingly tranquil California valley. The surface realism of Steinbeck's first mature work is enriched by hints of uncanny forces at work beneath.  ""Deep down it's mine, right to the center of the world,"" says Salinas Valley farmer Joseph Wayne about his land in John Steinbeck's To a God Unknown (1933). A sense of primeval magic dominates the novel as the farmer reverts to pagan nature worship and begins a tortuous journey toward catastrophe and ultimate understanding.  Steinbeck's sympathetic depiction of the raffish paisons of Tortilla Flat (1935), a ramshackle district above Monterey, first won him popular attention. The Flat's tenderhearted, resourceful, mildly corrupt, over-optimistic characters are a triumph of life-affirming humor.  In Dubious Battle (1936) plunges into the political struggle of the 1930s and paints a vigorous fresco of a migrant fruit-pickers' strike. Anticipating the collective portraiture of The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck poignantly traces the surges and shifts of group behavior.  With Of Mice and Men (1937), Steinbeck secured his status as one of the most influential American writers. Lennie and George, itinerant farmhands held together in the face of deprivation only by the frailest of dreams, have long since passed into American mythology. This novel, which Steinbeck called ""such a simple little thing,"" is now recognized as a masterpiece of concentrated emotional power.

[222414],90980.0,"[335, 349, 362]","Bestselling winner of the 1986 Pulitzer Prize, Lonesome Dove is an American classic. First published in 1985, Larry McMurtry's epic novel combined flawless writing with a storyline and setting that gripped the popular imagination, and ultimately resulted in a series of four novels and an Emmy-winning television miniseries. Now, with an introduction by the author, Lonesome Dove is reprinted in an S&S Classic Edition.  Lonesome Dove,  by Larry McMurtry, the author of Terms of Endearment,  is his long-awaited masterpiece, the major novel at last of the American West as it really was.  A love story, an adventure, an American epic, Lonesome Dove embraces all the West -- legend and fact, heroes and outlaws, whores and ladies, Indians and settiers -- in a novel that recreates the central American experience, the most enduring of our national myths.  Set in the late nineteenth century, Lonesome Dove is the story of a cattle drive from Texas to Montana -- and much more. It is a drive that represents for everybody involved not only a daring, even a foolhardy, adventure, but a part of the American Dream -- the attempt to carve out of the last remaining wilderness a new life.  Augustus McCrae and W. F. Call are former Texas Rangers, partners and friends who have shared hardship and danger together without ever quite understanding (or wanting to understand) each other's deepest emotions. Gus is the romantic, a reluctant rancher who has a way with women and the sense to leave well enough alone. Call is a driven, demanding man, a natural authority figure with no patience for weaknesses, and not many of his own. He is obsessed with the dream of creating his own empire, and with the need to conceal a secret sorrow of his own. The two men could hardly be more different, but both are tough, redoubtable fighters who have learned to count on each other, if nothing else.  Call's dream not only drags Gus along in its wake, but draws in a vast cast of characters:  -- Lorena, the whore with the proverbial heart of gold, whom Gus (and almost everyone else) loves, and who survives one of the most terrifying experiences any woman could have... -- Elmira, the restless, reluctant wife of a small-time Arkansas sheriff, who runs away from the security of marriage to become part of the great Western adventure... -- Blue Duck, the sinister Indian renegade, one of the most frightening villains in American fiction, whose steely capacity for cruelty affects the lives of everyone in the book... -- Newt, the young cowboy for whom the long and dangerous journey from Texas to Montana is in fact a search for his own identity... -- Jake, the dashing, womanizing exRanger, a comrade-in-arms of Gus and Call, whose weakness leads him to an unexpected fate... -- July Johnson, husband of Elmira, whose love for her draws him out of his secure life into the wilderness, and turns him into a kind of hero...  Lonesome Dove sweeps from the Rio Grande (where Gus and Call acquire the cattle for their long drive by raiding the Mexicans) to the Montana highlands (where they find themselves besieged by the last, defiant remnants of an older West).  It is an epic of love, heroism, loyalty, honor, and betrayal -- faultlessly written, unfailingly dramatic.

Also included are irreverent portraits of literary luminaries, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ford Maddox Ford, and insightful recollections of Hemingway's own early experiments with his craft.

At the core of Krakauer's book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith.

When Ludwig van Beethoven lay dying in 1827, a young musician named Ferdinand Hiller came to pay his respects to the great composer, snipping a lock of Beethoven's hair as a keepsake--as was custom at the time--in the process. For a century, the lock of hair was a treasured Hiller family relic, until it somehow found its way to the town of Gilleleje, in Nazi-occupied Denmark. There, it was given to a local doctor, Kay Fremming, who was deeply involved in the effort to help save hundreds of hunted and frightened Jews. After Fremming's death, his daughter assumed ownership of the lock, and eventually consigned it for sale at Sotheby's, where two American Beethoven enthusiasts, Ira Brilliant and Che Guevara, purchased it in 1994. Subsequently, they and others instituted a series of complex forensic tests in the hope of finding the probable causes of the composer's chronically bad health, his deafness, and the final demise that Ferdinand Hiller had witnessed all those years ago. The results, revealed for the first time here, are the most compelling explanation yet offered for why one of the foremost musicians the world has ever known was forced to spend much of his life in silence. In Beethoven's Hair, Russell Martin has created a rich historical treasure hunt, a tale of false leads, amazing breakthroughs, and incredible revelations.

The novels that followed established her as a master of Southern Gothic. This Library of America volume collects McCullers's complete novels for the first time in a single-volume edition that reveals the power and breadth of her haunting vision. ""McCullers's gift,"" writes Joyce Carol Oates, ""was to evoke, through an accumulation of images and musically repeated phrases, the singularity of experience, not to pass judgment on it."" McCullers effortlessly conveyed the raw anguish of her characters and the weird beauty of their perceptions. Set in small Georgia towns that are at once precisely observed and mythically resonant, McCullers's novels explore the strange, sometimes grotesque inner lives of characters who are often marginal and misunderstood. Above all, McCullers possessed an unmatched ability to capture the bewilderment and fragile wonder of adolescence. In The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1940), one of the most extraordinary debuts in modern American literature, an enigmatic deaf-mute draws out the haunted confessions of an itinerant worker, a young girl, a doctor, and a widowed owner of a small-town café. The disfiguring violence of desire is explored with shocking intensity in two shorter works, Reflections in a Golden Eye (1941) and The Ballad of the Sad Café (1943). The Member of the Wedding (1946), thought by many to be McCullers's masterpiece, hauntingly depicts a young girl's fascination with her brother's wedding. In 13-year-old Frankie Addams, confused, easily wounded, yet determined to survive, McCullers created her most indelible protagonist. Clock Without Hands (1960), her final novel, was completed against great odds in the midst of tremendous physical suffering. Set against the background of court-ordered school integration, it contains some of McCullers's most forceful social criticism.

There are no fences, no guards, no locked gates. But McLean Hospital is a mental institution-one of the most famous, most elite, and once most luxurious in America. McLean ""alumni"" include Olmsted himself, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, James Taylor and Ray Charles, as well as (more secretly) other notables from among the rich and famous. In its ""golden age,"" McLean provided as genteel an environment for the treatment of mental illness as one could imagine. But the golden age is over, and a downsized, downscale McLean-despite its affiliation with Harvard University-is struggling to stay afloat.  Gracefully Insane , by  Boston Globe  columnist Alex Beam, is a fascinating and emotional biography of McLean Hospital from its founding in 1817 through today. It is filled with stories about patients and doctors: the Ralph Waldo Emerson protege whose brilliance disappeared along with his madness Anne Sexton's poetry seminar, and many more. The story of McLean is also the story of the hopes and failures of psychology and psychotherapy of the evolution of attitudes about mental illness, of approaches to treatment, and of the economic pressures that are making McLean-and other institutions like it-relics of a bygone age. This is a compelling and often oddly poignant reading for fans of books like Plath's  The Bell Jar  and Susanna Kaysen's  Girl, Interrupted  (both inspired by their author's stays at McLean) and for anyone interested in the history of medicine or psychotherapy, or the social history of New England.",141.0,208.0,18.0,,Revised ed.,,1.0,9781586481612,,5a648c0cee9cee6ae3bc66b571193409,full/8/6/f/86fc201e0ed96e0da276db35a58eada3640d8650.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5864/9781586481612.jpg,,,1586481614,9781586481612,en,2003-01-07 00:00:00,,3.74,2255.0,Gracefully Insane : The Rise and Fall of America's Premier Mental Hospital,/Gracefully-Insane-Alex-Beam/9781586481612,354.0

She traces their exodus out of India 1,000 years ago and their astonishing history of persecution: enslaved by the princes of medieval Romania; massacred by the Nazis; forcibly assimilated by the communist regimes; evicted from their settlements in Eastern Europe, and most recently, in Western Europe as well. Whether as handy scapegoats or figments of the romantic imagination, the Gypsies have always been with us--but never before have they been brought so vividly to life.

""There is no body to be found. The birds may come and circle for a while... but they soon go elsewhere. When they are gone, the 'nothing, ' the 'no-body' that was there, suddenly appears. That is Zen. It was there all the time but the scavengers missed it, because it was not their kind of prey."" This gets at the humor, paradox, and joy that one feels in Merton's discoveries of Zen during the last years of his life, a joy very much present in this collection of essays. Exploring the relationship between Christianity and Zen, especially through his dialogue with the great Zen teacher D.T. Suzuki, the book makes an excellent introduction to a comparative study of these two traditions, as well as giving the reader a strong taste of the mature Merton. Never does one feel him losing his own faith in these pages; rather one feels that faith getting deeply clarified and affirmed.

Geryon, a young boy who is also a winged red monster, reveals the volcanic terrain of his fragile, tormented soul in an autobiography he begins at the age of five. As he grows older, Geryon escapes his abusive brother and affectionate but ineffectual mother, finding solace behind the lens of his camera and in the arms of a young man named Herakles, a cavalier drifter who leaves him at the peak of infatuation. When Herakles reappears years later, Geryon confronts again the pain of his desire and embarks on a journey that will unleash his creative imagination to its fullest extent. By turns whimsical and haunting, erudite and accessible, richly layered and deceptively simple, Autobiography of Red is a profoundly moving portrait of an artist coming to terms with the fantastic accident of who he is.

When prize-winning war correspondent Tony Horwitz leaves the battlefields of Bosnia and the Middle East for a peaceful corner of the Blue Ridge Mountains, he thinks he's put war zones behind him. But awakened one morning by the crackle of musket fire, Horwitz starts filing front-line dispatches again this time from a war close to home, and to his own heart. Propelled by his boyhood passion for the Civil War, Horwitz embarks on a search for places and people still held in thrall by America's greatest conflict. The result is an adventure into the soul of the unvanquished South, where the ghosts of the Lost Cause are resurrected through ritual and remembrance. In Virginia, Horwitz joins a band of 'hardcore' reenactors who crash-diet to achieve the hollow-eyed look of starved Confederates; in Kentucky, he witnesses Klan rallies and calls for race war sparked by the killing of a white man who brandishes a rebel flag; at Andersonville, he finds that the prison's commander, executed as a war criminal, is now exalted as a martyr and hero; and in the book's climax, Horwitz takes a marathon trek from Antietam to Gettysburg to Appomattox in the company of Robert Lee Hodge, an eccentric pilgrim who dubs their odyssey the 'Civil Wargasm.' Written with Horwitz's signature blend of humor, history, and hard-nosed journalism, Confederates in the Attic brings alive old battlefields and the new 'classrooms, courts, country bars' where the past and the present collide, often in explosive ways. Tony Horwitz's new book, Spying on the South: An Odyssey Across the American Divide, is available now.",132.0,203.0,24.13,,Reprint,,1.0,9780679758334,2 MAPS,268f3446eb34862457cda1e3759d2e54,full/b/d/5/bd5b748bc61bd36b575c4e16ab387ee84882c150.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/6797/9780679758334.jpg,Vintage Books,,067975833X,9780679758334,en,1999-03-01 00:00:00,,4.1,21313.0,Confederates in the Attic : Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War,/Confederates-Attic-Tony-Horwitz/9780679758334,312.98

Theodore Dalrymple, a British psychiatrist who treats the poor in a slum hospital and a prison in England, has seemingly seen it all.  Yet in listening to and observing his patients, he is continually astonished by the latest twist of depravity that exceeds even his own considerable experience.  Dalrymple's key insight in Life at the Bottom is that long-term poverty is caused not by economics but by a dysfunctional set of values, one that is continually reinforced by an elite culture searching for victims.  This culture persuades those at the bottom that they have no responsibility for their actions and are not the molders of their own lives. Drawn from the pages of the cutting-edge political and cultural quarterly City Journal, Dalrymple's book draws upon scores of eye-opening, true-life vignettes that are by turns hilariously funny, chillingly horrifying, and all too revealing-sometimes all at once.

According to Chomsky, propaganda is to democracy as the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state, and the mass media is the primary vehicle for delivering propaganda in the United States. From an examination of how Woodrow Wilson's Creel Commission succeeded, within six months, in turning a pacifist population into a hysterical, war-mongering population, to Bush Sr.'s war on Iraq, Chomsky examines how the mass media and public relations industries have been used as propaganda to generate public support for going to war. Chomsky further touches on how the modern public relations industry has been influenced by Walter Lippmann's theory of spectator democracy, in which the public is seen as a bewildered herd that needs to be directed, not empowered; and how the public relations industry in the United States focuses on controlling the public mind, and not on informing it.

In Imagery in Healing,  Jeanne Achterberg brings together modern scientific research and the practices of the earliest healers to support her claim that imagery is the world's oldest and most powerful healing resource. The book has become a classic in the field of alternative medicine and continues to be read by new generations of health care professionals and lay people. In Imagery in Healing,  Achterberg explores in detail the role of the imagination in the healing process. She begins with an exploration of the tradition of shamanism, ""the medicine of the imagination,"" surveying this time-honored way of touching the nexus of the mind, body, and soul.

He analyzed mental institutions in the remarkable Madness and Civilization; hospitals in The Birth of the Clinic; prisons in Discipline and Punish; and schools and families in The History of Sexuality. But the general reader as well as the specialist is apt to miss the consistent purposes that lay behind these difficult individual studies, thus losing sight of the broad social vision and political aims that unified them. Now, in this superb set of essays and interviews, Foucault has provided a much-needed guide to Foucault. These pieces, ranging over the entire spectrum of his concerns, enabled Foucault, in his most intimate and accessible voice, to interpret the conclusions of his research in each area and to demonstrate the contribution of each to the magnificent -- and terrifying -- portrait of society that he was patiently compiling. For, as Foucault shows, what he was always describing was the nature of power in society; not the conventional treatment of power that concentrates on powerful individuals and repressive institutions, but the much more pervasive and insidious mechanisms by which power ""reaches into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes, their discourses, learning processes and everyday lives"" Foucault's investigations of prisons, schools, barracks, hospitals, factories, cities, lodgings, families, and other organized forms of social life are each a segment of one of the most astonishing intellectual enterprises of all time -- and, as this book proves, one which possesses profound implications for understanding the social control of our bodies and our minds.",140.0,207.0,19.0,,American,12-17,1.0,9780394739540,,296c1e757c8dbed21b2a0106f12d785b,full/5/2/6/52659fb516ace52aca47548143b913296fef7d5e.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/3947/9780394739540.jpg,,,039473954X,9780394739540,en,1988-10-01 00:00:00,,4.14,2557.0,Power Knowledge,/Power-Knowledge-Michel-Foucault/9780394739540,334.0

The people of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii fascinate Ayla. Their clothes, customs, artifacts, even their homes--formed in great cliffs of vertical limestone--are a source of wonder to her. And in the woman Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of the Ninth Cave (and the one who initiated Jondalar into the Gift of Pleasure), she meets a fellow healer with whom to share her knowledge and skills. But as Ayla and Jondalar prepare for the formal mating at the Summer Meeting, there are difficulties. Not all the Zelandonii are welcoming. Some fear Ayla's unfamiliar ways and abhor her relationship with those they call flatheads and she calls Clan. Some even oppose her mating with Jondalar, and make their displeasure known. Ayla has to call on all her skills, intelligence, knowledge, and instincts to find her way in this complicated society, to prepare for the birth of her child, and to decide whether she will accept new challenges and play a significant role in the destiny of the Zelandonii.

For example, in the first part of the book, Patricia Walden has organized three chapters showing yoga poses with clear instructions that tell how to get into each pose and describe its benefits: chapter one is the Essential Sequence for all women, and includes modifications for people who cannot or should not do all the poses; chapter two is the Restorative Sequence for stress relief and relaxation; chapter three contains advanced poses that energize and tone.  The second part is presented in four sections that broadly represent the stages of a woman's life: teen years and early twenties, later twenties and thirties, midlife, and wisdom years. Each section contains chapters offering specific information about a particular health issue from author Linda Sparrowe, as well as sequences of yoga poses from Patricia Walden that address the problem. For example, the back care chapter includes information about common back problems and their causes (scoliosis, arthritis, lordosis, sciatica, kyphosis, among others) with an emphasis on: emotional and psychological roots of some back problems; physiological information about the spine and back muscles; general information about how yoga addresses different areas of the back; and finally, Patricia Walden's sequences of poses that target different back problems with the goal of not only relieving back pain but of strengthening, and healing old injuries and misalignments.

Individuals with this personality disorder are fully aware of the consequences of their actions and know the difference between right and wrong, yet they are terrifyingly self-centered, remorseless, and unable to care about the feelings of others. Perhaps most frightening, they often seem completely normal to unsuspecting targets - and they do not always ply their trade by killing. Presenting a compelling portrait of these dangerous men and women based on 25 years of distinguished scientific research, Dr Robert D. Hare vividly describes a world of con artists, hustlers, rapists, and other predators who charm, lie, and manipulate their way through life. Are psychopaths mad, or simply bad?

In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work.  The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, ""It's not the problem that causes our suffering; it's our thinking about the problem."" Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as it is.  Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. You'll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Work's power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible.  If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace.

The trade-off used to be simple but absolute: your business strategy either could focus on 'rich' information - customized products and services tailored to a niche audience - or could reach out to a larger market, but with watered-down information that sacrificed richness in favor of a broad, general appeal. Much of business strategy as we know it today rests on this fundamental trade-off. Now, say Evans and Wurster, the new economics of information is eliminating the trade-off between richness and reach, blowing apart the foundations of traditional business strategy. ""Blown to Bits"" reveals how the spread of connectivity and common standards is redefining the information channels that link businesses with their customers, suppliers, and employees.

An intriguing introduction to psychoanalysis, it shows how subconscious motives underlie even the most ordinary mistakes we make in talking, writing, and remembering. - The Interpretation of Dreams records Freud's revolutionary inquiry into the meaning of dreams and the power of the unconscious. - Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex is the seminal work in which Freud traces the development of sexual instinct in humans from infancy to maturity. - Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious expands on the theories Freud set forth in The Interpretation of Dreams. It demonstrates how all forms of humor attest to the fundamental orderliness of the human mind. - Totem and Taboo extends Freud's analysis of the individual psyche to society and culture. - The History of Psychoanalytic Movement makes clear the ultimate incompatibility of Freud's ideas with those of his onetime followers Adler and Jung.",146.0,216.0,47.5,,Modern library ed,,2.0,9780679601661,,303d67252338fe58b7a0610c87847623,full/c/7/6/c76e97832e064eabcb2d136ae4f008b3c2930a2e.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/6796/9780679601661.jpg,Random House Inc,,067960166X,9780679601661,en,1997-05-31 00:00:00,,3.91,487.0,Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud,/Basic-Writings-Sigmund-Freud-Sigmund-Freud/9780679601661,930.0

In this fascinating, controversial, and groundbreaking book, Carol Bowman reveals overwhelming evidence of past life memories in children. Not only are such experiences real, they are far more common than most people realize. Bowman's extraordinary investigation was sparked when her young son, Chase, described his own past-life death on a Civil War battlefield--an account so accurate it was authenticated by an expert historian. Even more astonishing, Chase's chronic eczema and phobia of loud noises completely disappeared after he had the memory. Inspired by Chase's dramatic healing, Bowman compiled dozens of cases and wrote this comprehensive study to explain how very young children remember their past lives, spontaneously and naturally. In Children's Past Lives,  she tells how to distinguish between a true past life memory and a fantasy, offers practical advice to parents on how to respond to a past life memory, and shows how to foster the spiritual and healing benefits of these experiences. Perhaps the most moving, convincing, and best-documented evidence yet for life after death, Children's Past Lives will stand alongside the classics of Betty J. Eadie, Raymond Moody, and Brian Weiss in its power to comfort, uplift, and transform our thinking about life after death",102.0,184.0,25.65,,,,1.0,9780553574852,,124c238e9b0308698ca72532d739c2ca,full/a/f/5/af5d57a26bcf4ecd38f29fc84c29b07affc088df.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5535/9780553574852.jpg,Bantam USA,,055357485X,9780553574852,en,1998-02-01 00:00:00,,4.26,500.0,Children's Past Lives,/Childrens-Past-Lives-Carol-Bowman/9780553574852,181.0

For more than fifteen years, best-selling author and historian Hampton Sides has traveled widely across the continent exploring the America that lurks just behind the scrim of our mainstream culture. Reporting for Outside, The New Yorker, and NPR, among other national media, the award-winning journalist has established a reputation not only as a wry observer of the contemporary American scene but also as one of our more inventive and versatile practitioners of narrative non-fiction.  In these two dozen pieces, collected here for the first time, Sides gives us a fresh, alluring, and at times startling America brimming with fascinating subcultures and bizarre characters who could live nowhere else. Following Sides, we crash the redwood retreat of an apparent cabal of fabulously powerful military-industrialists, drop in on the Indy 500 of bass fishing, and join a giant techno-rave at the lip of the Grand Canyon. We meet a diverse gallery of American visionaries-- from the impossibly perky founder of Tupperware to Indian radical Russell Means to skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. We retrace the route of the historic Bataan Death March with veterans from Sides' acclaimed WWII epic, Ghost Soldiers. Sides also examines the nation that has emerged from the ashes of September 11, recounting the harrowing journeys of three World Trade Center survivors and deciding at the last possible minute not to embed on the Iraqi front-lines with the U.S. Marines.

Do you want to quilt for comfort and pleasure -- and not to win some high-falutin' quilting contest? Weary of worrying about what others will think of your color choices -- or your pieced points? Or your applique stitches? That Dorky Homemade Look: Quilting Lessons from a Parallel Universe is the quilting companion you've been wishing for. Lisa Boyer, a popular columnist for Quilting Today magazine, gives you permission to quilt because you love it. She clears your path of all those merciless judgments pronounced by the Quilting Queens. She invites you to make quilts that are full of life. This funny book offers these nine principles for the 20 million quilters in America: 1. Pretty fabric is not acceptable. Go right back to the quilt shop and exchange it for something you feel sorry for. 2. Realize that patterns and templates are only someone's opinion and should be loosely translated. Personally, I've never thought much of a person who could only make a triangle with three sides. 3. When choosing a color plan for your quilt, keep in mind that the colors will fade after a hundred years or so. This being the case, you will need to start with really bright colors. 4. You should plan on cutting off about half your triangle or star points. Any more than that is showing off. 5. If you are doing applique, remember that bigger is dorkier. Flowers should be huge. Animals should possess really big eyes. 6. Throw away your seam ripper and repeat after me: Oops. Oh, no one will notice. 7. Plan on running out of border fabric when you are three-quarters of the way finished. Complete the remaining border with something else you have a lot of, preferably in an unrelated color family. 8. You should be able to quilt equally well in all directions. I had to really work on this one. It was difficult to make my forward stitching look as bad as my backward stitching, but closing my eyes helped. 9. When you have put your last stitch in the binding, you are still only half finished. Your quilt must now undergo a thorough conditioning. Give it to someone you love dearly--to drag around the house, wrap up in, spill something on, and wash and dry until it is properly lumpy. No reason not to have quiltmaking be a pleasure, says Lisa Boyer, who has as firm a grip on her sense of humor as she does on her quilting needles. If we didn't make Dorky Homemade quilts, all the quilts in the world would end up in the Beautiful Quilt Museum, untouched and intact. Quilts would just be something to look at. We would forget that quilts are lovable, touchable, shreddable, squeezable, chewable, and huggable -- made to wrap up in when the world seems to be falling down around us.",140.0,216.0,10.0,,Original ed.,,1.0,9781561483518,,bf6129ff5ddadcb69f0bc20c4b78be4d,full/f/d/0/fd077c9285a1517c5d7b127d73c49acdd9815240.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5614/9781561483518.jpg,"Good Books,U.S.",,1561483516,9781561483518,en,2002-05-16 00:00:00,,3.83,126.0,That Dorky Homemade Look : Quilting Lessons From A Parallel Universe,/That-Dorky-Homemade-Look-Lisa-Boyer/9781561483518,202.0

Loners as a group deserve to be reassessed,to claim their rightful place, rather than be perceived as damaged goods that need to be ""fixed.""

But the book is far more than narrative. Every event is an occasion for remembering, for meditating, for Job-like anguish in the struggle to accept and understand.  A profoundly faith-affirming book, Lament for a Son gives eloquent expression to a grief that is at once unique and universal--a grief for an individual, irreplaceable person.

Many of their designs and techniques have not been identified elsewhere in Morocco.These women regularly invented motifs to record key events in the tribe's history. They wove Moroccan War Rugs in memory of the twenty-six-year struggle against French domination.Their newly invented designs join many traditional carpet and textile motifs, some of which go back to the Bronze Age or earlier. These archaic designs reflect an older North African weaving tradition now almost entirely lost. In their isolation, the women of the tribe preserved an important part of the world's textile heritage while showing an ability to adapt to changing events.The Saulniers have collected Moroccan pile rugs, flatweaves, and other textiles since 1975.

Vast in scope, exhaustive in original research, written with passion, narrative skill, and human sympathy,  A People's Tragedy is a profound account of the Russian Revolution for a new generation. Many consider the Russian Revolution to be the most significant event of the twentieth century. Distinguished scholar Orlando Figes presents a panorama of Russian society on the eve of that revolution, and then narrates the story of how these social forces were violently erased. Within the broad stokes of war and revolution are miniature histories of individuals, in which Figes follows the main players' fortunes as they saw their hopes die and their world crash into ruins. Unlike previous accounts that trace the origins of the revolution to overreaching political forces and ideals, Figes argues that the failure of democracy in 1917 was deeply rooted in Russian culture and social history and that what had started as a people's revolution contained the seeds of its degeneration into violence and dictatorship.

Yet this important tome has been passed over by many readers frustrated by Marx's difficult style and his preoccupation with nineteenth-century events of little relevance to today's reader.

Here, Johnson's almost mythic personality--part genius, part behemoth, at once hotly emotional and icily calculating--is seen at its most nakedly ambitious. This multifaceted book carries the President-to-be from the aftermath of his devastating defeat in his 1941 campaign for the Senate-the despair it engendered in him, and the grueling test of his spirit that followed as political doors slammed shut-through his service in World War II (and his artful embellishment of his record) to the foundation of his fortune (and the actual facts behind the myth he created about it).  The culminating drama--the explosive heart of the book--is Caro's illumination, based on extraordinarily detailed investigation, of one of the great political mysteries of the century. Having immersed himself in Johnson's life and world, Caro is able to reveal the true story of the fiercely contested 1948 senatorial election, for years shrouded in rumor, which Johnson was not believed capable of winning, which he ""had to"" win or face certain political death, and which he did win-by 87 votes, the ""87 votes that changed history.""

He focuses closely not only on Johnson, whom we see harnessing every last particle of his strategic brilliance and energy, but on Johnson's ""unbeatable"" opponent, the beloved former Texas Governor Coke Stevenson, who embodied in his own life the myth of the cowboy knight and was himself a legend for his unfaltering integrity. And ultimately, as the political duel between the two men quickens--carrying with it all the confrontational and moral drama of the perfect Western--Caro makes us witness to a momentous turning point in American politics: the tragic last stand of the old politics versus the new--the politics of issue versus the politics of image, mass manipulation, money and electronic dazzle.",156.0,232.0,31.0,,Reprint,,1.0,9780679733713,,89b089e193ec74961caf246a34f6e2b4,full/c/2/b/c2b13340969c48030fedae3b84bb39219f8e2dfd.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/6797/9780679733713.jpg,Ballantine Books Inc.,,067973371X,9780679733713,en,1992-07-21 00:00:00,,4.19,23613.0,Means Of Ascent Vol 2 Lyndon Johnson Vintage USA,/Means-Ascent-Vol-2-Lyndon-Johnson-Vintage-USA-Robert-Caro/9780679733713,800.0

The search moves from the neon-lit brilliance of Las Vegas to the shadowy underworld patrolled by the police. We visit a sleep laboratory, where scientists try to understand what happens to our bodies and in our brains when sleep claims us.

What's left is an entirely new kind of existence, one full of passion, presence, and infinite possibility."" This book is a wake-up call from your own heart. It is a roadmap to love--not the romantic, familial or platonic kind, but a love that most of us have rarely tasted. This love exists prior to and apart from any specific type of expression. It is a dynamic, primal force that connects us with the surrounding universe, and provides the key to our deepest and most lasting fulfillment if we can learn to tap into its awesome power. Raphael Cushnir's own experience has taught him that we often close ourselves to love-that life's challenges, losses, and disappointments can shut us down emotionally and physically, leaving us stagnant in our work and relationships, and feeling empty and alone. Setting Your Heart on Fire presents his invigorating, step-by-step process for reopening and reawakening your heart and spirit, and for learning to use this ever-present love to blaze through any obstacle you may face. The Seven Invitations in this book will guide you through a courageous assessment of your choices, emotions, behaviors, and beliefs, revolutionizing your approach to stress and adversity, and revealing a brand new way of thinking and being. In accepting the Invitations, you will learn how to let go of harmful thoughts and heal deeply rooted emotional wounds. You will begin to open yourself to love's creativity and wisdom, struggling less yet achieving more. You will discover how to infuse everyday experiences with a breathtaking sense of joy and wonder. And your relationships - with family, friends, co-workers and romantic partners - will become a vehicle for profound and thrilling change. Each Invitation provides practical, easy-to-grasp examples that allow you to put its teachings immediately into practice. Over time, you will learn to access love in even the most difficult situations, unlocking the door to a fearless, authentic life.

Working with these slogans and through the practice of meditation, Start Where You Are  shows how we can all develop the courage to work with our inner pain and discover joy, well-being, and confidence.",153.0,226.0,13.0,New edition,New edition,,1.0,9781570628399,,f21b68638313a5685700161bed9aba04,full/2/1/3/2137017c396c3cae5a736dd5991f4887e31aaffa.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5706/9781570628399.jpg,,,1570628394,9781570628399,en,2001-08-21 00:00:00,,4.24,10725.0,Start Where You Are,/Start-Where-You-Are-Pema-Chodron/9781570628399,254.0

Quetzalcoatl Ce Acatl (born in A.D. 947)--whose stature has been compared to that of Christ, Buddha, and Krishna--was the key figure in the development of the spiritual culture of the Toltecs. In The Gospel of the Toltecs the author has gathered Nahua and Maya codexes, Spanish chronicles of conquest, and native oral tradition to recount the life of Quetzalcoatl: his temptation and fall; his initiation with sacred mushrooms; his long journey in search of spiritual enlightenment; his triumphant return to the Toltec land; and his subsequent teaching, self-immolation, ascension, and promise of return. Quetzalcoatl's teachings make up the Toltecayotl, or Toltequity--the art of intentional doing--which provides an initiatic guide for the transformation of individuals and society, while his personal history is a guide for the development of Nahualli, the magical side of human awareness.

School teachers are using meditation with children, and doctors are recommending it for their patients. There are many approaches to meditation, but they fundamentally fall into two categories: guided and unguided. Unguided meditation is free form-one simply seeks to empty the mind and come into the present moment. Guided meditation is directed - one invites particular experiences. Guided meditation audio recordings abound. However, Meditations for Self-Discovery: Guided Journeys for Communicating with Your Inner Self is one of the first collections of guided meditations in book form. It is perfect for group facilitators who would rather lead meditations themselves than play recordings. For individuals, these ""journeys"" can be read silently as meditations or poetry, or be read aloud and recorded - it has been found that listening to guidance in one's own voice can make it more powerful. These meditations are designed take readers and listeners to new places within themselves, helping them feel uplifted and energized. Afterward, the meditation experience can be interpreted like dreams, providing insight into where one is mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. There are forty-five meditations in this ebook, each lasting about fifteen minutes, although they can be shortened or extended to meet the needs of those using them. Titles include ""Journey Through Your Mind,"" ""The Crystal Cave,"" ""Visiting Venus,"" ""The Angel's Gift,"" ""A Friend Across the Universe,"" and ""The Great Mother."" Meditations for Self-Discovery is a valuable tool for leaders of personal growth groups, including support and therapy groups, healing circles, and classes of all kinds. The meditations can promote relaxation and self-knowledge, as well as help bring their group together. Doctors, nurses, therapists, and other healers can use the imagery in this book to create a healing atmosphere in their patients and among their staff. Members of the clergy may wish to use this book with their congregations. Children love meditation, and the vivid images in Meditations can stimulate their imagination as well as their self-knowledge - parents or teachers can invite children to draw, dance or musicalize what they experienced in meditation, and can discuss their experience with them afterward.",140.0,216.0,8.0,,,,1.0,9781885469014,,6a7b4c351b83465b205aa0050bf68aea,full/3/f/c/3fc5f708232f324a19a549ff30c9e98fcb38b43e.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8854/9781885469014.jpg,,,1885469012,9781885469014,en,2020-05-15 00:00:00,,3.67,6.0,Meditations for Self-Discovery : Guided Journeys for Communicating with Your Inner Self,/Meditations-for-Self-Discovery-Shepherd-Hoodwin/9781885469014,141.0

In this book Wolinsky gives us a path to our essential nature by allowing chaos to be the rule rather than the exception. A process whereby chaos becomes our friend, a familiar experience, a welcome home or even a fuel to bring us back to our universal self. Wolinsky shows us that dysfuntional personality is created as a resistance to chaos. All of our efforts to order chaos through resisting it by creating more and more systems to manage it have fallen short. It appears obvious that a personality born of chaos and resistance to chaos can only beget more chaos and resistance. ""The Tao of Chaos"" is about looking at our most resisted experience and finding that chaos is no longer an enemy but a friend.

Seizing on the striking similarities between the religious vision of this ""heretic"" pharaoh and the teachings of Moses, Sigmund Freud was the first to argue that Moses was in fact an Egyptian. Now Ahmed Osman, using recent archaeological discoveries and historical documents, contends that Akhenaten and Moses were one and the same man. In a stunning retelling of the Exodus story, Osman details the events of Moses/Akhenaten's life: how he was brought up by Israelite relatives, ruled Egypt for seventeen years, angered many of his subjects by replacing the traditional Egyptian pantheon with worship of the Aten, and was forced to abdicate the throne. Retreating to the Sinai with his Egyptian and Israelite supporters, he died out of the sight of his followers, presumably at the hands of Seti I, after an unsuccessful attempt to regain his throne. Osman reveals the Egyptian components in the monotheism preached by Moses as well as his use of Egyptian royal ritual and Egyptian religious expression. He shows that even the Ten Commandments betray the direct influence of Spell 125 in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Moses and Akhenatenprovides a radical challenge to long-standing beliefs concerning the origin of Semitic religion and the puzzle of Akhenaten's deviation from ancient Egyptian tradition.

Leih Tzu was a well-known Taoist master in the fourth century B.C., and his sly critiques of a Confucius provide abundant opportunities for the reader to explore the contrasts between the rational and irrational, the male and female, the structured and the spontaneous. ""Who Is Really Happy"" uses the discovery of a human skull on the roadside to probe into the question of immortality and how misery arises out of the existence of the ego. ""A Man Who Knows How to Console Himself"" looks beneath the apparent cheerfulness of a wandering monk and asks if there is really a happiness that endures through life's ups and downs. ""No Regrets"" is a parable about the difference between the knowledge that is gathered from the outside and the ""knowing"" that arises from within. ""No Rest for the Living"" uses a dialogue between a despondent seeker and his master to reveal the limits of philosophy and the crippling consequences of living for the sake of some future goal. ""Best Be Still, Best Be Empty"" discusses the difference between the path of the will, the via affirmitiva of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, versus the path of the mystic, the via negativa of Buddha and Lao Tzu. Tao: The Pathless Path also features a Q&A section that addresses how Taoist understanding applies to everyday life in concrete, practical terms. Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the ""1000 Makers of the 20th Century"" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India.

And now, with the guidance of Edgar Cayce, we can learn how to mine our psychic strengths for happier and healthier lives. Here are the readings of The Sleeping Prophet, condensed and simplified--the wisdom to help us make the right decisions affecting all facets of our lives. Cayce speaks out on: The sources of psychic development, reincarnation, Karma and grace, dreams, meditation, prayer, personal health (including diet and exercises, ) holistic healing, sexuality, spirituality, rejuvenation, religion, spiritual psychology, and much more. Cayce offers us the keys to insight, enlightenment, and total fulfillment.",108.0,174.0,19.0,,Revised ed.,,1.0,9780553252781,,0d3967a365902ad01b1f790ceceb17c6,full/d/7/1/d71cdafb4093dbe2b6fc99fcd55c7ac94655007c.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5532/9780553252781.jpg,Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group,,055325278X,9780553252781,en,1994-06-01 00:00:00,,3.78,106.0,Edgar Cayce Primer,/Edgar-Cayce-Primer-Herbert-Puryear/9780553252781,134.0

It begins with a brief history of spiritual development from before ancient Egypt right up to the present. It continues by explaining the secrets of the aura and the chakras. In this section you'll learn about the importance of the third eye chakra. It is related to the pineal gland and the third eye. Opening the third eye aids intuition, creativity, and psychic abilities. You can do this easily by toning, doing vibrational work or chanting Thoh (rhymes with toe) at a middle or high C note. This triggers a vibration in the pineal which cause the third eye and its chakra to open. The exact techniques are included in the book. If you open the crown chakra (associated with the pituitary gland) you can improve some of your natural psychic abilities, including clairaudience, clairvoyance, and clairsentience. Vibrational work for this chakra uses the sound May. Breathing techniques and the exact way of toning to open the chakra are fully explained. You'll also learn how to see the aura and interpret its colors, as well as how to open all of the chakras. The book also explains techniques to send the mysterious kundalini energy through the chakras. But this book has more! It includes the secrets of channeling, such as working with angels and spirit guides. It goes on to share methods of astral projection and then reveals the secrets of reincarnation.

These Crusades changed the course of Western history, but less known is the fact that they also were the meeting ground for two legendary secret societies: The Knights Templar and their Muslim counterparts, the Assassins. In The Templars and the Assassins: The Militia of Heaven, occult scholar and secret society member James Wasserman provides compelling evidence that the interaction of the Knights Templar and the Assassins in the Holy Land transformed the Templars from the Pope's private army into a true occult society, from which they would sow the seeds of the Renaissance and the Western Mystery Tradition.

The myth thus suggests that this is the first book ever written, and of direct divine provenance. A diverse compendium of ancient Hebrew magical lore, this book was quite possibly the original source for later, traditional literature on angelic hierarchy, astrology, Qabalah, and Gematria. Moses Gaster mentions this in his introduction to The Sword of Moses (1896) suggesting that the Sepher Rezial could be a primary source for many magic and qabalistic books of the Middle Ages. Sepher Rezial Hemelach is a compilation of five books: The Book of the Vestment, The Book of the Great Rezial, The Holy Names, The Book of the Mysteries, and The Book of the Signs of the Zodiac. It includes extensive explanatory text on the holy names of God, the divisions of Heaven and Hell, the names and hierarchy of the angels and spirits, as well as symbolic interpretations of both the Book of Genesis and Sepher Yetzirah. It also includes material on astronomy, astrology, gematria, and various magical talismans, most notably those used for protection during childbirth.

She was compelled to search for the facts and details that eventually confirmed the existence of her past life and led to an emotional reunion with her family. But Jenny Cockell's extraordinary journey doesn't end there. Past Lives, Future Lives tells the continuing story of the psychic experiences that spurred her to investigate not only other past lives but the future -- as far ahead as the twenty-third century. Her amazingly detailed glimpses of the future are more than merely personal images; they allow her to formulate an overall view of what the future holds for us all -- including a planet much lower in population, but also safer and more pleasant than the world of today. Past Lives, Future Lives presents a fascinating look at the continuity of past, present, and future.

With facts about green foods such as spirulina and blue-green algae and information about the ""regeneration diets"" used by cancer patients and arthritics, it is also an accessible primer on nutrition--and a inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes. The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program: because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing ""sweet"" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!) Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds ""healing, awareness, and peace"" by following his program. The diet is certainly ascetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these ""negative energy"" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to the immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he offers dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation.

Why would a married woman with a thoroughly Protestant background and often more doubt than faith be drawn to the ancient practice of monasticism, to a community of celibate men whose days are centered on a rigid schedule of prayer, work, and scripture?

Part record of her time among the Benedictines, part meditation on various aspects of monastic life, The Cloister Walk demonstrates, from the rare perspective of someone who is both an insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world-- its liturgy, its ritual, its sense of community-- can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives.

Accessing the deepest self, the true self, can be learned, he says, by freeing ourselves from the conflicting, unreasonable demands of the mind and living present, fully, and intensely, in the Now.",152.0,228.0,21.59,,,,2.0,9781577311522,,eb623812d02732d0bf5fb9db9df1be86,full/4/2/7/427ab6739162fcebf0a2e6cd80b169f5329d30d9.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5773/9781577311522.jpg,,,1577311523,9781577311522,en,1999-11-16 00:00:00,,4.13,226825.0,The Power of Now,/Power-Now-Eckhart-Tolle/9781577311522,439.98

Only one document was discovered completely intact among the 25,000 fragments of papyrus, parchment, and hammered copper known as the Dead Sea Scrolls: the Great Isaiah Scroll. Nearly one thousand years older than existing copies of the Old Testament's Book of Isaiah, the twenty-two-foot-long parchment was still rolled and sealed in its original earthen vase when it was discovered in 1946. The completeness of the Isaiah Scroll offers unprecedented insight into the power of an ancient mystery -- a lost mode of prayer -- that modern science is just beginning to understand. Displayed today in Jerusalem's Shrine of the Book Museum, the Great Isaiah Scroll is believed to be so precious by modern scholars that it's withdrawn into a vault beneath the building's floor in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. In The Isaiah Effect, the dazzling new work from the author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking Between the Worlds, scientist and visionary Gregg Braden offers a radical departure from traditional interpretations of Isaiah's text. Weaving state-of-the-art research with his extensive knowledge of the ancient Essenes (the creators of the scroll texts), Braden invites us on a journey where science and miracles are merged into a new wisdom -- and lead to a startling conclusion. He suggests that Isaiah, the first Old Testament prophet, left precise instructions to the people of the future describing an unconventional mode of prayer. Using principles recognized only recently in quantum physics, Braden demonstrates how Isaiah's nonreligious, nondenominational form of prayer transcends time and distance to bring healing to our bodies and peace to the nations of our modern world.",134.0,203.0,18.0,,Revised ed.,,1.0,9780609807965,1 LINE DRAWING,a1f56a4f14d526bba348bdc115326de4,full/8/7/f/87f7c0d5965344777207839f856f08603b0bbee1.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/6098/9780609807965.jpg,Crown Publications,,060980796X,9780609807965,en,2001-08-03 00:00:00,,4.17,1063.0,Isaiah Effect,/Isaiah-Effect-Gregg-Braden/9780609807965,324.0

Today, after being embraced around the world and selling more than seven million copies, Fulghum's book retains the potency of a common though no less relevant piece of wisdom: that the most basic aspects of life bear its most important opportunities.  Here Fulghum engages us with musings on life, death, love, pain, joy, sorrow, and the best chicken-fried steak in the continental United States.

All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten is brimming with the very stuff of life and the significance found in the smallest details.

Mitchell Silver believes that many third- and fourth-generation American Jews have retained only a hazy knowledge of their ethnic traditions and rich history. But as they watch their own children grow up in a materialist, multicultural, Christian-dominated American society, many contemporary Jewish parents are loathe to abandon their distinctive heritage and wish to pass it on to their offspring. Silver begins by situating the possible emergence of a secular American Judaism within the context of attempts to reconcile the imperatives of tradition and modernity. He then proposes specific spiritual, moral, and institutional pathways that could lead to this reconceived form of Judaism. While the book's emphasis is on the possibilities and values of a secular American Jewish identity, Silver also proposes a supplemental school curriculum for children that would lay the groundwork for a viable contemporary Judaism.",153.16,227.33,19.56,,New.,,1.0,9781558491809,black & white illustrations,dbfb43f800c12855a310d9c1e01f2792,full/5/4/7/5479d07ba6960cb1dad570046db71b02cc6418df.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9781/5584/9781558491809.jpg,,,1558491805,9781558491809,en,1998-12-31 00:00:00,,3.0,2.0,Respecting the Wicked Child : Philosophy of Secular Jewish Identity and Education,/Respecting-Wicked-Child-Mitchell-Silver/9781558491809,394.63

Niles Elliot Goldstein is a young rabbi who sets out to find God in tough and often scary situations: dogsledding above the Arctic Circle, taking the Silk Road into Central Asia without a visa, being chased by a grizzly bear, cruising with DEA agents through the South Bronx, and spending a night in jail in New York City's Tombs. He explores the connections between struggle and growth, fear and transcendence, and uncertainty and faith, seeking the boundary where the finite meets the Infinite. Goldstein is not alone in making this kind of pilgrimage. There has always been a strong tradition of seekers who looked for revelation outside conventional religious settings and encountered God in moments of anguish, terror, and pain. Goldstein juxtaposes his own experiences with those of some of the great historical figures of Judaism and Christianity -- Jonah and St. John of the Cross, Moses Maimonides and Julian of Norwich, Nachman of Bratslav and Martin Luther -- as well as lesser known mystics and preachers, and he discovers, as they did, that it can sometimes take a journey to the edge to recognize God's presence in our lives.",139.7,215.9,12.7,,,,1.0,9780609804889,,82f067770970bd830e12b4a9ae8d9d4a,full/e/5/3/e53b845e3a79e8ee3845aee93855f5999557b798.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/6098/9780609804889.jpg,BELL TOWER,,060980488X,9780609804889,en,2001-04-24 00:00:00,,3.61,18.0,God at the Edge : Searching for the Divine in Uncomfortable and Unexpected Places,/God-at-Edge-Niles-Goldstein/9780609804889,294.84

The remarkable forty-year history of the people who established the first Buddhist monastery outside of Asia in the history of the world has never been told. Michael Downing wondered why. I'm living proof of why you better not speak out, explained one ordained Zen priest. The degree to which I was scapegoated publicly was most effective in keeping everyone else quiet. In 1959, a Soto Zen priest took leave of his family in Japan to minister to the congregation of a Buddhist temple in San Francisco. Alan Watts and others spread the word that an authentic Zen Roshi was living there, and students, poets, drifters, and seekers began to attend his lectures. Impressed by their sincerity and commitment, Suzuki Roshi began to offer instruction in zazen (meditation) and other Buddhist practices to these devoted young spiritual pioneers. The San Francisco Zen Center was born. And then, in 1983, meltdown. A sex scandal rocked Zen Center, and it triggered tragedies and headlines about abuse of power that called into question the whole matter of alternative religious practice in America. Overnight the most prominent community of Buddhists in the West found itself at the vanguard of a cultural revolt against spiritual authority. For Shoes Outside the Door, Michael Downing spent three years studying documents and interviewing more than eighty people who were there, at ground zero.

The sutta--included here in the translation by Bhikkhu Bodhi--contains the Buddha's teachings in response to questions posed by King Ajatasattu. Why, the king asked, should we give up the satisfactions of worldly life and devote ourselves to meditation? What are the tangible benefits to be gained from following the Buddha's way? In answering this question, the Buddha provides a compact synopsis of the entirety of the spiritual path, and Ayya Khema expands on this with her characteristic approach--simple, direct, experiential, and loving.  An important aspect of the sutta is an account of the eight meditative absorptions, or jhanas--states of mind that bring joy, serenity, and peace and that open the way to clarity and liberation. Ayya Khema, who was herself adept at the eight absorptions, confidently leads the reader to, through, and beyond the jhanas, following the Buddha's plan.

His first book, Returning to Silence,  emphasized the need to return to our original, enlightened state of being, and became one of the classics of Zen in America. In You Have to Say Something,  selections from his talks have been collected to address another key theme of Katagiri's teaching: that of bringing Zen insight to bear on our everyday experience. To live life fully, Katagiri says, means to take care of your life day by day, moment to moment, right here, right now. To do this, he teaches, we must plunge into our life completely, bringing to it the same wholeheartedness that is required in Zen meditation. When we approach life in this way, every activity--everything we do, everything we say--becomes an opportunity for manifesting our own innate wisdom.

""Wiesel has never allowed himself to be diverted from the role of witness for the martyred Jews and survivors of the Holocaust, and by extension for all those who through the centuries have asked Job's question: 'What is God doing and where is His justice?' Here in a masterful series of mythic portraits, drawing upon Bible tales and the Midrashim (a body of commentary), Wiesel explores 'the distant and haunting figures that molded him' Adam, Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Job. With the dramatic invention of a Father Mapple and the exquisite care of a Talmudic scholar, Wiesel interprets the wellsprings of Jewish religious tradition as the many faces of man's greatness facing the inexplicable. In an intimate relationship with God it is possible to complain, to demand. Adam and Eve in sinning ""cried out"" against the injustice of their entrapment; Cain assaulted God rather than his brother; and Abraham's agreement to sacrifice his son placed the burden of guilt on Him who demanded it. As for Job, Wiesel concludes that he abdicated his defiance as did the confessing Communists of Stalin's time to 'underline the implausibility' of his trial, and thus become the accuser.

That's how Stella Suberman's father's store, Bronson's Low-Priced Store, in Concordia, Tennessee, was known locally. The Bronsons were the first Jews to ever live in that tiny town (1920 population: 5,318) of one main street, one bank, one drugstore, one picture show, one feed and seed, one hardware, one barber shop, one beauty parlor, one blacksmith, and many Christian churches. Aaron Bronson moved his family all the way from New York City to that remote corner of northwest Tennessee to prove himself a born salesman--and much more. Told by Aaron's youngest child,  The Jew Store is that rare thing--an intimate family story that sheds new light on a piece of American history. Here is One Man's Family with a twist--a Jew, born into poverty in prerevolutionary Russia and orphaned from birth, finds his way to America, finds a trade, finds a wife, and sets out to find his fortune in a place where Jews are unwelcome. With a novelist's sense of scene, suspense, and above all, characterization, Stella Suberman turns the clock back to a time when rural America was more peaceful but no less prejudiced, when educated liberals were suspect, and when the Klan was threatening to outsiders. In that setting, she brings to life her remarkable father, a man whose own brand of success proves that intelligence, empathy, liberality, and decency can build a home anywhere.

Struggling with her return to the Christian church after many years away, Kathleen Norris found it was the language of Christianity that most distanced her from faith. Words like judgment, faith, dogma, salvation, sinner--even Christ--formed what she called her scary vocabulary, words that had become so codified or abstract that their meanings were all but impenetrable. She found she had to wrestle with them and make them her own before they could confer their blessings and their grace. Blending history, theology, storytelling, etymology, and memoir, Norris uses these words as a starting point for reflection, and offers a moving account of her own gradual conversion.

He jumped at the chance, much to the dismay of his wife, who wisely believed in the old adage about not trusting Greeks bearing gifts. No longer a tourist, Stone quickly learned hard lessons about Greek skills at bargaining and their use of the Evil Eye.

She arrived in Kyoto, a city she had dreamed about but never seen, with two bags, an open-ended plane ticket, and the ability to speak only sushi-bar Japanese. She left a year later, having learned the language, the art of kaiseki, and what was truly important to her. Through special introductions and personal favors, Victoria was able to attend one of Kyoto's most prestigious tea schools, where this ago-old Japanese art has been preserved for generations and where she was taken under the wing of an American expatriate who became her mentor in the highly choreographed rituals of this extraordinary culinary discipline. During her year in Kyoto, Victoria explored the mysterious and rarefied world of tea kaiseki, living a life inaccessible to most foreigners. She also discovered the beguiling realm of modern-day Japanese food--the restaurants, specialty shops, and supermarkets. She participated in many fast-disappearing culinary customs, including making mochi (chewy rice cakes) by hand, a beloved family ritual barely surviving in a mechanized age. She celebrated the annual cleansing rites of New Year's, donning an elaborate kimono and obi for a thirty-four-course extravaganza.

Focusing on the Italian-American kitchen--the cooking she encountered when she first came to America as a young adolescent--Lidia pays homage to this ""cuisine of adaptation born of necessity."" But she transforms it subtly with her light, discriminating touch, using the authentic ingredients, not accessible to the early immigrants, which are all so readily available today. The aromatic flavors of fine Italian olive oil, imported Parmigiano-Reggiano and Gorgonzola dolce latte, fresh basil, oregano, and rosemary, sun-sweetened San Marzano tomatoes, prosciutto, and pancetta permeate the dishes she makes in her Italian-American kitchen today. And they will transform for you this time-honored cuisine, as you cook with Lidia, learning from her the many secret, sensuous touches that make her food superlative.  You'll find recipes for Scampi alla Buonavia (the garlicky shrimp that became so popular when Lidia served the dish at her first restaurant, Buonavia), Clams Casino (with roasted peppers and good American bacon), Caesar Salad (shaved Parmigiano makes the difference), baked cannelloni (with roasted pork and mortadella), and lasagna (blanketed in her special Italian-American Meat Sauce).  But just as Lidia introduced new Italian regional dishes to her appreciative clientele in Queens in the seventies, so she dazzles us now with pasta dishes such as Bucatini with Chanterelles, Spring Peas, and Prosciutto, and Long Fusilli with Mussels, Saffron, and Zucchini. And she is a master at teaching us how to make our own ravioli, featherlight gnocchi, and genuine Neapolitan pizza.

Simpson, Invisible Darkness is the story of one of the more bizarre cases in recent memory--killings so sensational that they prompted the Canadian government, in the interests of justice, to silence its national press and to lock foreign journalists out of the courts. To all appearances, Paul and Karla Bernardo had a fairytale marriage: beautiful working-class girl weds bright upper-middle-class guy and they buy a fashionable dream house in the suburbs. But, bored with his straight, prestigious accounting job, Paul soon went freelance as an international smuggler. He also revealed his boredom with conventional sex--enough so that, one Christmas Eve, he persuaded his wife to drug her own sister and engage in a menage a trois, during which the sister died (a bungling coroner ruled her death accidental). The couple then upped the ante, kidnapping and imprisoning several high school girls for sexual marathons, which they videotaped before savagely murdering their captives. When the girls' bodies were found, the police were stymied (although Paul had been accused of rape and given a DNA test that vanished for two years and only recently was linked to some fifty sexual-assault cases) until Karla tried to have her husband arrested for wife beating. During questioning, she confessed to the crimes and is now serving two concurrent twelve-year sentences for manslaughter in exchange for testifying against her husband, who was jailed for life.",114.0,178.0,25.91,,Reprint,,1.0,9780553568547,,a5c760b1cf82c868bdc38dbce2763496,full/4/3/f/43fcbd008a8cd705a8ad556871f7148ec7ae5f29.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5535/9780553568547.jpg,Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group,,055356854X,9780553568547,en,2002-08-01 00:00:00,,3.89,1733.0,Invisible Darkness: the Strange Case of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka,/Invisible-Darkness-Strange-Case-Paul-Bernardo-Karla-Homolka-Stephen-Williams/9780553568547,272.0

Having spent her summers in Tuscany for the past several years, Frances Mayes relished the opportunity to experience the pleasures of primavera, an Italian spring. A sabbatical from teaching in San Francisco allowed her to return to Cortona--and her beloved house, Bramasole--just as the first green appeared on the rocky hillsides. Bella Tuscany, a companion volume to Under the Tuscan Sun,  is her passionate and lyrical account of her continuing love affair with Italy. Now truly at home there, Mayes writes of her deepening connection to the land, her flourishing friendships with local people, the joys of art, food, and wine, and the rewards and occasional heartbreaks of her villa's ongoing restoration. It is also a memoir of a season of change, and of renewed possibility. As spring becomes summer she revives Bramasole's lush gardens, meets the challenges of learning a new language, tours regions from Sicily to the Veneto, and faces transitions in her family life. Filled with recipes from her Tuscan kitchen and written in the sensuous and evocative prose that has become her hallmark, Bella Tuscany is a celebration of the sweet life in Italy.",137.0,203.0,17.0,,Reprint,,1.0,9780767902847,,d3be9a147d8dd797a725043b3cd6c224,full/a/e/9/ae9cd9d1925ab34e355bc0fa5caa04638a6a1279.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/7679/9780767902847.jpg,,,076790284X,9780767902847,en,2000-05-01 00:00:00,,3.76,12942.0,Bella Tuscany : The Sweet Life in Italy,/Bella-Tuscany-Frances-Mayes/9780767902847,236.0

In doing so, he adapted such popular novels as The Killing, Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining and selected a wide variety of genres for his films -- black comedy (Dr. Strangelove), science fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey), and war (Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket). Because he was peerless in unveiling the intimate mysteries of human nature, no new film by Kubrick ever failed to spark debate or to be deeply pondered. Kubrick (1928-1999) has remained as elusive as the subjects of his films. Unlike many other filmmakers he was not inclined to grant interviews, instead preferring to let his movies speak for themselves. By allowing both critics and moviegoers to see the inner workings of this reclusive filmmaker, this first comprehensive collection of his relatively few interviews is invaluable. Ranging from 1959 to 1987 and including Kubrick's conversations with Gene Siskel, Jeremy Bernstein, Gene D. Phillips, and others, this book reveals Kubrick's diverse interests -- nuclear energy and its consequences, space exploration, science fiction, literature, religion, psychoanalysis, the effects of violence, and even chess -- and discloses how each affects his films. He enthusiastically speaks of how advances in camera and sound technology made his films more effective.",152.0,229.0,7.62,,New,,1.0,9781578062973,"1, black & white illustrations",d13515ca1d6d88ff9e490b4fb9c46126,full/d/2/6/d26dc3218855e31de25799f4c32b167bd09b6067.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5780/9781578062973.jpg,,,1578062977,9781578062973,en,2010-01-22 00:00:00,,4.12,532.0,Stanley Kubrick : Interviews,/Stanley-Kubrick-Gene-D-Phillips/9781578062973,340.19

As autobiography, Brainard's method was brilliantly simple: to set down specific memories as they rose to the surface of his consciousness, each prefaced by the refrain ""I remember"": ""I remember when I thought that if you did anything bad, policemen would put you in jail."" Brainard's enduring gem of a book has been issued in various forms over the past thirty years. In 1970, Angel Hair books published the first edition of I Remember, which quickly sold out; he wrote two subsequent volumes for Angel Hair, More I Remember (1972) and More I Remember More (1973), both of which proved as popular as the original. In 1973, the Museum of Modern Art in New York published Brainard's I Remember Christmas, a new text for which he also contributed a cover design and four drawings. Excerpts from the Angel Hair editions appeared in Interview, Gay Sunshine, The World and the New York Herald. Then in 1975, Full Court Press issued a revised version collecting all three of the Angel Hair volumes and added new material, using the original title I Remember.

On January 28, 1945, 121 hand-selected U.S. troops slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines. Their mission: March thirty rugged miles to rescue 513 POWs languishing in a hellish camp, among them the last survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March. A recent prison massacre by Japanese soldiers elsewhere in the Philippines made the stakes impossibly high and left little time to plan the complex operation.  In Ghost Soldiers Hampton Sides vividly re-creates this daring raid, offering a minute-by-minute narration that unfolds alongside intimate portraits of the prisoners and their lives in the camp. Sides shows how the POWs banded together to survive, defying the Japanese authorities even as they endured starvation, tropical diseases, and torture. Harrowing, poignant, and inspiring, Ghost Soldiers is the mesmerizing story of a remarkable mission.

But even as he recounts his side-splitting misadventures in each of these locales, Dyer is always able to sneak up and surprise you with insight into much more serious matters.

En sus páginas el lector se encontrará con episodios como el conmovedor retrato de sus abuelos, con quienes se crió en su aldea natal de Aracataca, o la descripción del asesinato de un candidato presidencial en Bogotá, del que fue testigo ocular. García Márquez da cuenta de las gentes, los lugares y los sucesos que le sirvieron de acicate como periodista y como narrador.

At the age of 34, war-weary from working as a psychiatric social worker, with barely any Italian, and precious little money, she plunged into a fascinating Sicilian world. Every imaginable problem had to be overcome, not only financial difficulties but local authorities and a house staff who initially felt no loyalty to the new Signorina but who gradually accepted her as a respected member of their small community. To help make ends meet, for many years she ran Casa Cuseni as a pensione and to her doors came Roald Dahl, Tennessee Williams, Bertrand Russell and Henry Faulkner. But just as important to her life and her story are the Sicilians with whom she shared the love and care of Casa Cuseni: Don Ciccio the local mafia leader, Vincenzio, general manservant who recited while he served the meals, Beppe, a Don Juan who scented his eyebrows and his moustache to attract the local girls; and above all the steadfast cook and housekeeper who lives with Daphne still and to whom this book is dedicated.",131.0,196.0,21.0,,,,1.0,9781860496486,"Section: 8, Colour",a4aa9cbbaac9bfd4e764b4e33ee454ce,full/d/1/7/d1766f09b921a429fda261b70147cca7ba9a0cca.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8604/9781860496486.jpg,Virago Press Ltd,,1860496482,9781860496486,en,2000-05-18 00:00:00,,3.47,487.0,A House in Sicily,/House-Sicily-Daphne-Phelps/9781860496486,214.0

Kelly was one of the best-known figures of the Irish folk music movement of the 1960s and 1970s. A Dubliner from the north inner city. He emigrated to Britain in 1958. There he first became involved in the growing international folk music scene in which Ewan MacColl was a central figure. In 1962 Luke Kelly returned to Dublin and quickly became a central figure in the city's burgeoning folk music community. He formed a folk group with Drew, McKenna, Ciaran Bourke and John Sheahan, which he named The Dubliners. In 1965, Kelly married the actress Deirdre O'Connell, one of the founders of the Focus Theatre. In the mid-1960s, Luke moved to England and on returning, he rejoined the Dubliners. Luke remained a politically engaged musician, and many of the songs he recorded dealt with social issues, the arms race and war, workers' rights and Irish nationalism. Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1980, and died in 1984.

My answer was that a hero is someone who commits a courageous action without considering the consequences--a soldier who crawls out of a foxhole to drag an injured buddy to safety. And I also meant individuals who are slightly larger than life: Houdini and Lindbergh, John Wayne, JFK, and Joe DiMaggio. Now my definition is completely different. I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles: a fifteen-year-old boy who landed on his head while wrestling with his brother, leaving him barely able to swallow or speak; Travis Roy, paralyzed in the first thirty seconds of a hockey game in his freshman year at college. These are real heroes, and so are the families and friends who have stood by them."" The whole world held its breath when Christopher Reeve struggled for life on Memorial Day, 1995. On the third jump of a riding competition, Reeve was thrown headfirst from his horse in an accident that broke his neck and left him unable to move or breathe. In the years since then, Reeve has not only survived, but has fought for himself, for his family, and for the hundreds of thousands of people with spinal cord injuries in the United States and around the world. And he has written Still Me, the heartbreaking, funny, courageous, and hopeful story of his life. Chris describes his early success on Broadway opposite the legendary Katherine Hepburn, the adventure of filming Superman on the streets of New York, and how the movie made him a star. He continued to move regularly between film acting and theater work in New York, Los Angeles, and at the WIlliamstown Theatre Festival in the Berkshires. Reunited with his Bostonians director, James Ivory, in 1992, he traveled to England to work with Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins in The Remains of the Day. The Man who cannot move has not stopped moving. He has established a charitable foundation to raise awareness and money for research on spinal cord injuries. His work as director of the HBO film In the Gloaming earned him an Emmy nomination, one of five that the film received. His speeches at the Democratic National Convention and the Academy Awards inspired people around the country and the world. He has testified before Congress on behalf of health insurance legislation, lobbied for increased federal funding for spinal cord research, and developed a working relationship with President Clinton. With dignity and sensitivity, he describes the journey he has made--physically, emotionally, spiritually. He explores his complex relationship with his parents, his efforts to remain a devoted husband and father, and his continuing and heroic battle to rebuild his life. This is the determined, passionate story of one man, a gifted actor and star, and how he and his family came to grips with the kind of devastating, unexplainable shock that fate can bring to any of us. Chris and Dana Reeve have gathered the will and the spirit to create a new life, one responsive and engaged and focused on the future.",109.0,174.0,26.0,,Ballantine Book,,1.0,9780345432414,"Illustrations, unspecified",ae3d14ad468b39d3907cb41de1978a5a,full/b/1/2/b12a8fb2ef706f11eb33c9a8be55666e3e121e4a.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/3454/9780345432414.jpg,Random House Inc,,034543241X,9780345432414,en,1999-06-01 00:00:00,,4.09,2460.0,Still Me,/Still-Me-Christopher-Reeve/9780345432414,191.0

Fifty years later, Roma, an artist living in Germany, attended a screening of Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, and instantly knew that ""the girl in the red coat""--the only splash of color in the film--was her. Thus began a harrowing journey into the past, as Roma Ligocka sought to reclaim her life and put together the pieces of a shattered childhood.

Une maman qui s'inquiète pour lui, sa constipation, son avenir et le cancer du poumon qu'il va sûrement choper, comme le fils de Mme Bergerin. Après une virée affectueuse (et éprouvante) chez les parents, il retrouve le silence de sa petite maison dans la verdure, et son chat (baptisé Adolf en raison d'un caractère ""affirmé""), qui se fait charcuter par le gros chien d'un sale con de chasseur. À cette occasion, il rencontre Émilie, vétérinaire de son état, et un chouette petit vieux qui ramasse des mûres. Ça lui fait un amour et un ami.

In his palavering, stream-of-conscious style that has marked him as one of the major writers and innovators of postwar European literature, Hrabal gives a humorous and at times moving account of life in Prague under Nazi occupation, Communism, and the brief euphoria following the revolution of 1989 when anything seemed possible, even pink tanks. Interspersed are fragmented memories of trips taken to Britain - as he attempted to track down every location mentioned in Eliot's ""The Waste Land"" - and the United States, where he ends up in one of Dylan Thomas's haunts comparing the waitresses to ones he knew in Prague.

With his characteristic elegance and insight, Jonathan Spence explores how the West has understood China over seven centuries. Ranging from Marco Polo's own depiction of China and the mighty Khan, Kublai, in the 1270s to the China sightings of three twentieth-century writers of acknowledged genius-Kafka, Borges, and Calvino-Spence conveys Western thought on China through a remarkable array of expression. Peopling Spence's account are Iberian adventurers, Enlightenment thinkers, spinners of the dreamy cult of Chinoiserie, and American observers such as Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Ezra Pound, and Eugene O'Neill. Taken together, these China sightings tell us as much about the self-image of the West as about China. ""Wonderful. . . .

They endure thousands of miles of lonely training in the Yukon trying to avoid thin ice, wolves, and rogue moose; they put up with the amused skepticism of Alaskan locals; and they pit themselves against the ultimate, fickle adversary--nature. RUNNING NORTH is the true story of how Ann Cook, her husband, George, and their young daughter, Kathleen, moved to Alaska and how their Siberians became the first team from the lower forty-eight states to finish the Yukon Quest. It tracks George on his horrific journey through the Yukon, recording the frostbite, the hallucinations that come with exhaustion, the wolves, and the nights out on the ice at minus ninety degrees Fahrenheit. This is the great story of man struggling against nature and surviving. But unlike most accounts of high adventure that center solely on the adventurer and the quest, RUNNING NORTH is also the story of Ann Cook, who drove the truck and carried the gear and kept the family together. In the tradition of MY OLD MAN AND THE SEA, she tells both stories in simple, elegant prose that reveals the tragedy, joy, and folly that lie on either side of the curtain separating the adventurer from the world left behind. They run up against crazy landlords, win over gruff neighbors, drive a broken-down truck that sucks oil like Alaskans suck coffee, listen to a radio show that keeps trappers in contact with the world, meet mysterious fishermen who appear without notice and disappear without a sign, fight with a young cousin who will betray them in the end, protect their young daughter from the dangers of their new wild world, and stare awestruck at the wide sweep of Alaskan landscape.

The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and ""common sense."" This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during ""the times that try men's souls"" in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative ""Forester"" letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791-1792), written in response to Edmund Burke's attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine's detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794-1795), Paine's most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine's life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine's work, and an index.

Ambrose's iconic New York Times bestseller about the ordinary men who became the World War II's most extraordinary soldiers: Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, US Army. They came together, citizen soldiers, in the summer of 1942, drawn to Airborne by the $50 monthly bonus and a desire to be better than the other guy. And at its peak--in Holland and the Ardennes--Easy Company was as good a rifle company as any in the world. From the rigorous training in Georgia in 1942 to the disbanding in 1945, Stephen E. Ambrose tells the story of this remarkable company. In combat, the reward for a job well done is the next tough assignment, and as they advanced through Europe, the men of Easy kept getting the tough assignments. They parachuted into France early D-Day morning and knocked out a battery of four 105 mm cannon looking down Utah Beach; they parachuted into Holland during the Arnhem campaign; they were the Battered Bastards of the Bastion of Bastogne, brought in to hold the line, although surrounded, in the Battle of the Bulge; and then they spearheaded the counteroffensive. Finally, they captured Hitler's Bavarian outpost, his Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden. They were rough-and-ready guys, battered by the Depression, mistrustful and suspicious. They drank too much French wine, looted too many German cameras and watches, and fought too often with other GIs. But in training and combat they learned selflessness and found the closest brotherhood they ever knew. They discovered that in war, men who loved life would give their lives for them. This is the story of the men who fought, of the martinet they hated who trained them well, and of the captain they loved who led them.

NIGHT SKY theatrically explores what Steven Hawking has called the two mysteries remaining to us: the brain and the cosmos. When she is hit by a car, the brilliant and articulate astronomer Anna loses her ability to speak, a condition known as aphasia. What emerges from her mouth is a hodge-podge of unconnected words alternately confusing, funny, original and wise -- and sometimes all four. In a series of brief, often comic episodes, the play follows Anna through her illness and ultimate acceptance of herself - a personal triumph, despite a continuing infirmity - and dramatizes the impact of her changed circumstances on her lover, her teen-aged daughter, and her professional life.",127.0,203.0,3.0,,,,1.0,9780573693205,black & white illustrations,1f08f57a928c2b9c6e77ff75871ec589,full/3/7/c/37cb61c66a14f24cf93a9f64044fb58932e8fef2.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5736/9780573693205.jpg,"Samuel French, Inc",,057369320X,9780573693205,en,2010-03-08 00:00:00,,3.83,12.0,Night Sky,/Night-Sky-Susan-Yankowitz/9780573693205,82.0

From his first appearance in print, in the guise of the eccentric, opinionated, voluble ""Silence Dogood"" (1722), to his last published article, a searing satire against slavery (1790), he covered every aspect of ""the question of America"" with radiant clarity, wit, and penetration. This Library of America collection begins with items written by Franklin during his early years in Boston and London (1722-1726), including the complete ""Silence Dogood"" essay series. The volume also includes the famous ""Busy-Body"" essays (1728-1729); many of the news articles and essays he penned after he purchased the failing Pennsylvania Gazette (which eventually became the most widely read newspaper in the colonies); and various political satires, pamphlets, and personal correspondence written while he lived in Philadelphia from 1726 to 1757. The book concludes with material he published while a diplomat in London from 1757 to 1775 (including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets). Controversial in his own time, and the subject of vigorous debate ever since--to Matthew Arnold he exemplified ""victorious good sense,"" while to D. H. Lawrence he was ""the first dummy American""--Franklin emerges in this collection as a figure of extraordinary complexity for readers to discover, consider, and appreciate anew.

Inevitably it follows that anyone with an independent mind must become ""one who resists or opposes an authority or established convention""--a rebel. Usually rebellion is done so quietly that no one notices. But when others (especially others with power) recognize the disobedience, the rebel becomes the rebel. And if enough people come to agree with (and follow) the rebel, we have a devil. Until, of course, still more people agree. And then, finally, we have greatness.

Also included are ""The Other Mexico,"" ""Return to the Labyrinth of Solitude,"" ""Mexico and the United States,"" and ""The Philanthropic Ogre,"" all of which develop the themes of the title essay and extend his penetrating commentary to the United States and Latin America.",136.0,209.0,30.48,,,,1.0,9780802150424,,a540cbb038d5964150be81702f1f5d0c,full/0/4/9/049e96215622c6162e485330b7db3520ec435b3f.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8021/9780802150424.jpg,,,080215042X,9780802150424,es,1994-01-27 00:00:00,,4.15,11011.0,The Labyrinth of Solitude ; the Other Mexico ; Return to the Labyrinth of Solitude ; Mexico and the United States ; the Philanthropic Ogre,/Labyrinth-Solitude-Other-Mexico-Return-Labyrinth-Solitude-Mexico-United-States-Philanthropic-Ogre-Octavio-Paz/9780802150424,442.0

[15229],77784.0,"[285, 292, 301, 2649]","This Library of America edition is the biggest and best edition of Walt Whitman's writings ever published. It includes all of his poetry and what he considered his complete prose. It is also the only collection that includes, in exactly the form in which it appeared in 1855, the first edition of Leaves of Grass. This was the book, a commercial failure, which prompted Emerson's famous message to Whitman: ""I greet you at the beginning of a great career."" These twelve poems, including what were later to be entitled ""Song of Myself"" and ""I Sing the Body Electric,"" and a preface announcing the author's poetic theories were the first stage of a massive, lifelong work. Six editions and some thirty-seven years later, Leaves of Grass became one of the central volumes in the history of world poetry.  Each edition involved revisions of earlier poems and the incorporation of new ones. As it progressed, it was hailed by Emerson, Thoreau, Rosetti and others, but was also, as with the sixth edition in 1881-82, beset by charges of obscenity for such poems as ""A Woman Waits for Me."" Printed here is the final, great culminating edition of 1891-92, the last supervised by Whitman himself just before his death.  Whitman's prose is no less extraordinary. Specimen Days and Collect (1882) includes reminiscences of nineteenth-century New York City that will fascinate readers in the twenty-first, notes on the Civil War, especially his service in Washington hospitals, and trenchant comments on books and authors. Democratic Vistas (1871), in its attacks on the misuses of national wealth after the Civil War, is relevant to conditions in our own time, and November Boughs (1888) brings together retrospective prefaces, opinions, and random autobiographical bits that are in effect an extended epilogue on Whitman's life, works, and times. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",135.0,206.0,45.0,,,,2.0,9780940450028,,43144cbbb84d91e9d1f6395652005452,full/c/1/1/c118761abd1fdabb016aad1cf7465b3340727196.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/9404/9780940450028.jpg,,,094045002X,9780940450028,en,1982-05-06 00:00:00,,4.3,7181.0,Walt Whitman : Poetry and Prose (LOA #3),/Walt-Whitman-Walt-Whitman/9780940450028,854.0

Together with an Introduction, biographical notes, and commentary, the collection charts Artaud's work from his early association with surrealism, through his founding of the Theatre Alfred Jarry, to the invocation of his compelling vision in his most famous manifesto, The Theatre and Its Double. Artaud's poetic and inspirational writings called for a fundamental regeneration of Western art. He wanted to return the theatre to its roots in ritual and to transform the audience through total emotional, psychic, and physical involvement. Anarchic and disruptive, he was misunderstood, silenced, and ostracized in his lifetime, but was later championed as an icon of the sixties counterculture.

In one of his best-loved plays, Pygmalion,  which later became the basis for the musical My Fair Lady,  Shaw compels the audience to see the utter absurdity and hypocrisy of class distinction when Professor Henry Higgins wagers that he can transform a common flower girl into a lady--and then pass her off as a duchess--simply by changing her speech and manners. In Major Barbara Shaw spins out the drama of an eccentric millionaire, a romantic poet, and a misguided savior of souls, Major Barbara herself, in a topsy-turvy masterpiece of sophisticated banter and urbane humor.

So begins Homer ""Sonny"" Hickam Jr.'s extraordinary memoir of life in Coalwood, West Virginia-a hard-scrabble little company town where the only things that mattered were coal mining and high school football. But in 1957, after the Soviet satellite Sputnik shot across the Appalachian sky, Sonny and his teenaged friends decided to do their bit for the U.S. space race by building their own rockets--and Coalwood, Sonny and A powerful story of growing up and of getting out, of a mother's love and a father's fears, Homer Hickam's memoir Rocket Boys proves, like Angela's Ashes and Russell Baker's Growing Up before it, that the right storyteller and the right story can touch readers' hearts and enchant their souls. In a town where the only things that mattered were coal-mining and high-school football, where the future was regarded with more fear than hope, a young man watched the Soviet satellite Sputnik race across the West Virginia sky--and soon found his future in the stars. In 1957, Homer H. ""Sonny"" Hickam, Jr., and a handful of his friends were inspired to start designing and launching the home-made rockets that would change their lives and their town forever. Looking back after a distinguished NASA career, Hickam shares the story of his youth, taking readers into the life of the little mining town of Coalwood and the boys who would come to embody its dreams. Step by step, with the help (and occasional hindrance) of a collection of unforgettable characters, the boys learn not only how to turn scrap into sophisticated rockets that fly miles into the sky, but how to sustain their dreams as they dared to imagine a life beyond its borders in a town that the postwar boom was passing by. Rocket Boys has already caught the eye of Hollywood: The producer of Field of Dreams is now working to produce a major motion picture in time for next year's Academy Awards.

Now, for the first time, the works of America's supreme poet of the imagination are collected in one authoritative Library of America volume. Here are all of Stevens's published books of poetry, side-by-side for the first time with the haunting lyrics of his later years and early work that traces the development of his art. From the rococo inventiveness of Harmonium, his first volume (including such classics as ""Sunday Morning"" and ""Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird""), through ""Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,"" ""Esthétique du Mal,"" ""The Auroras of Autumn,"" and the other large-scale masterpieces of his middle years, to the austere final poems of ""The Rock,"" Stevens's poetry explores with unrelenting intensity the relation between the world and the human imagination, between nature as found and nature as invented, and the ways poetry mediates between them. The volume presents over ninety poems uncollected by Stevens, including early versions of often-discussed works like ""The Comedian as the Letter C"" and ""Owl's Clover."" Also here is the most comprehensive selection of Stevens's prose writings. The Necessary Angel (1951), his distinguished book of essays, joins nearly fifty shorter pieces, many previously uncollected: reviews, speeches, short stories, criticism, philosophical writings, and responses to the work of T. S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, and other poets. The often-dazzling aphorisms Stevens gathered over the years are included, as are his plays and selections from his poetic notebooks. Rounding out the volume is a fifty-year span of journal entries and letters, newly edited from manuscript sources, which provide fascinating glimpses of Stevens's thoughts on poetry and the creative process. The volume also contains explanatory notes, a detailed chronology of Stevens' life, and an essay on textual selection.

They represent the crowning achievements of his career. O'Neill described Ah, Wilderness! as ""the way I would have liked my boyhood to have been."" Set in the summer of 1906, it affectionately depicts the warm, close family of sixteen-year-old Richard Miller and the innocence with which he faces the trials of first love, strong drink, and sexual temptation. John Loving, hero of Days Without End, is split by his lack of faith into two selves: John and his Mephistophelian double Loving, who wears John's death mask and plots his destruction. Burdened by guilt but desperately wanting to love, John struggles with Loving's nihilistic hatred in what O'Neill termed his ""modern miracle play."" In A Touch of the Poet, Irish tavern-keeper Con Melody is drawn by his proud past as a Byronic cavalry hero of the Napoleonic Wars toward a fatal confrontation with his wealthy Yankee neighbors, the Harfords. Throughout More Stately Mansions, the idealistic yet cunning Simon Harford, his wife, Sara Melody Harford, and his mother, Deborah, continually shift roles and alliances as they engage in an eerie psychological and sexual battle for possession of each other and their own maddeningly elusive dreams. This volume presents the never-before-published complete text of the revised typescript for this unfinished play. The derelict inhabitants of Harry Hope's saloon in The Iceman Cometh find solace in their comradeship until their drifting calm is destroyed by the visiting salesman Theodore Hickey, who insists that they abandon all ""pipe dreams"" and face the truth about their lives. O'Neill carefully orchestrates the voices of over a dozen characters to form a chorus of overwhelming despair and surprising compassion. Hughie is a one-act dialogue between a reminiscing gambler and a weary hotel night clerk about the promise and loneliness of city life. Long Day's Journey into Night unsparingly dissects the pain, rage, guilt, and love that drive a wounded family apart and bind it together. In their summer home the four Tyrones--James, a proud actor haunted by poverty, his devout, morphine-addicted wife, Mary, and their sons, Jamie, a cynical drunkard, and Edmund, an aspiring poet--slowly unveil the truth about their lives until they can no longer hope either to save or to escape one another. Published and produced posthumously, it won O'Neill his fourth Pulitzer Prize. In its elegiac coda, A Moon for the Misbegotten, Jamie Tyrone seeks the peace that has long eluded him in the arms of sharp-tongued Josie Hogan. The volume concludes with ""Tomorrow"" (1917), O'Neill's only published short story.

Caught in the rift between his father's and his mother's families, Horace is separated from what family he has left to spend a horrifying year on a decaying plantation worked by black convicts from a nearby prison. Even more devastating is the reunion with his mother, his sister Lily Dale, and his new stepfather--a reunion that will leave him an orphan in spirit, if not in name.

Leading off a provocative debate, she asks if the difficulty we had as a country in defending ourselves on September 11 suggests serious flaws in our national security. The need to act in'a matter of minutes' has been invoked to justify military arrangements increasingly outside the citizenry's control, yet the only successful defense on September 11 was carried out, after a vote, by the passengers themselves on hijacked Flight 93. Arguments made at the time of the writing of the Constitution judged that the only plausible way to defend the home ground was to have actions measured against the norms of civilian life: the military had to be'held within a civil frame.' Scarry asks, have we strayed too far from this model? Does our authoritarian conception of national defense diminish our capacity to protect ourselves? Is it legal? Is it moral?

His plays have been performed all around the world, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, the Ivory Coast, the United States, France, Germany and other European countries. Born and educated in China, Gao studied French literature at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute between 1957-1962. After the Cultural Revolution, he became a resident playwright at the Beijing People's Art Theatre. His works, including Bus Stop, Absolute Signal, and Wilderness Man, were trend-setting and have created many controversies and a wave of experimental drama in China. In 1987 he settled in Paris, France and continued to write in Chinese and in French. He was awarded the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government in 1992. The present collection contains five of Gao Xingjian's most recent works: The Other Shore (1986), Between Life and Death (1991), Dialogue and Rebuttal (1992), Nocturnal Wanderer (1993), and Weekend Quartet (1995). One finds poetry, comedy as well as tragedy in the plays, which are graced by beautiful language and original imagery. Combining Zen philosophy and a modern worldview, they serve to illuminate the gritty realities of life, death, sex, loneliness, and exile, all essential concerns in Gao's understanding of the existence of modern man. The plays are also manifestations of the dramatist's idea of the tripartite actor, a process by which the actor neutralizes himself and achieves a disinterested observation of his self in performance.",6.0,9.0,17.78,,,,1.0,9789622018624,,e734013e058adcb934ac7b0f2aa2518f,full/6/b/a/6bac2afec04b501c60961cc26edd128bd9ce0891.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9789/6220/9789622018624.jpg,,,9622018629,9789622018624,en,2000-01-21 00:00:00,,3.43,134.0,The Other Shore : Plays,/Other-Shore-Xingjian-Gao/9789622018624,1000.0

""More Tree Talk"" is an entirely revised edition of that classic volume that brings the book up-to-date with the current situation.Like the original, ""More Tree Talk"" features a running narrative punctuated by individual portraits that personalize the issues. It translates political and academic aspects of forestry into human terms, focusing on those whose lives and livelihoods depend on the outcome of the debates currently raging -- old-time woodsmen, loggers, naturalists, restoration workers, timber company executives.Ray Raphael explores the new forestry practices, theories, and controversies that have emerged in the past decade as he addresses problems of a declining resource base and increasing regulatory policies.

Blyth believed that the spirit of haiku is present in all great poetry; inspired by him, the editor of this volume has included lines from such poets as Wordsworth, Keats, Tennyson, Thoreau, and Hopkins, presented here in haiku form.

[195233],57363.0,[287],"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama <br>Over the past decade, Donald Margulies has written some of the most insightful works in contemporary American drama. His body of work includes `The Loman Family Picnic, Sight Unseen, The Model Apartment` and `Collected Stories,` and with each succeeding work his audiences have grown. It is no surprise that his newest work is his most critically successful yet. As with all of Margulies's work, he is a master of observing what might be considered the ordinary moments of life and its foibles with fresh ears. `Dinner with Friends` is a funny yet bittersweet examination of the married lives of two couples who have been extremely close for dozens of years. Although it seems to be treading on familiar ground, Dinner keeps changing its perspective to show how one couple's breakup can have equally devastating effects on another's stability. <br>`This is a smart and subtle play that understand there are no easy answers as people evolve and relationships settle into routine.`--David Kaufman, `Daily News` <br>`Donald Margulies has drawn one of the most complex and convincing portraits of a marriage in recent memory.`--Debra Jo Immergut, `The Wall Street Journal`<br>``Dinner with Friends` is entertainment as succulent as it is sobering.`--John Simon, `New York Magazine` <br>Donald Margulies lives with his wife and son in New Haven, CT.

In Who Will Feed China: Wake-up Call for a Small Planet, Lester Brown shows that even as water becomes more scarce in a land where 80 percent of the grain crop is irrigated, as per-acre yield gains are erased by the loss of cropland to industrialization, and as food production stagnates, China still increases its population by the equivalent of a new Beijing each year. When Japan, a nation of just 125 million, began to import food, world grain markets rejoiced. But when China, a market ten times bigger, starts importing, there may not be enough grain in the world to meet that need - and food prices will rise steeply for everyone. Analysts foresaw that the recent four-year doubling of income for China's 1.2 billion consumers would increase food demand, especially for meat, eggs, and beer. But these analysts assumed that food production would rise to meet those demands. Brown shows that cropland losses are heavy in countries that are densely populated before industrialization, and that these countries quickly become net grain importers.

The poems Hughes wrote celebrated the experience of invisible men and women: of slaves who rushed the boots of Washington; of musicians on Lenox Avenue; of the poor and the lovesick; of losers in the raffle of night. They conveyed that experience in a voice that blended the spoken with the sung, that turned poetic lines into the phrases of jazz and blues, and that ripped through the curtain separating high from popular culture. They spanned the range from the lyric to the polemic, ringing out wonder and pain and terror--and the marrow of the bone of life. The poems in this collection were chosen by Hughes himself shortly before his death in 1967 and represent work from his entire career, including The Negro Speaks of Rivers, The Weary Blues, Still Here, Song for a Dark Girl, Montage of a Dream Deferred, and Refugee in America.

From the publication of his first collections, A Boy's Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), Frost was recognized as a poet of unique power and formal skill, and the enduring significance of his work has been acknowledged by each subsequent generation. His poetry ranges from deceptively simply pastoral lyrics and genial, vernacular genre pieces to darker meditations, complex and ironic. Here, based on extensive research into his manuscripts and published work, is the first authoritative and truly comprehensive collection of his writings. Brought together for the first time in a Library of America single volume is all the major poetry, a generous selection of uncollected poems, all of Frost's dramatic writing, and the most extensive gathering of his prose writings ever published, several of which are printed here for the first time. The core of this collection is the 1949 Complete Poems of Robert Frost, the last collection supervised by Frost himself. This version of the poems is free of unauthorized editorial changes introduced into subsequent editions. Also included is In the Clearing (1962), Frost's final volume of poetry. Verse drawn from letters, articles, pamphlets, and journals makes up the largest selection of uncollected poems ever assembled, including nearly two dozen beautiful early works printed for the first time. Also gathered here are all the dramatic works: three plays and two verse masques. The unprecedented prose section includes more than three times as many items as any other collection available. It is rich and diverse, presenting many newly discovered or rediscovered pieces. Especially unusual items include Frost's contribution to John F. Kennedy's inauguration and two fascinating 1959 essays on ""The Future of Man."" Several manuscript items are published here for the first time, including the essays ""'Caveat Poeta'"" and ""The Way There,"" Frost's remarks on being appointed poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1958, the preface to a proposed new edition of North of Boston, and many others. A selection of letters represents all of Frost's important comments about prosody, poetics, style, and his theory of ""sentence sounds.""

This relationship is now capturing the attention of activists, scientists, policymakers, and the public, from negotiations at the United Nations to concerns about the neighborhood park.

What policies are needed to protect it? Who participates in protecting biodiversity: governments, industry, activists? This book explores answers to these questions and, in doing so, shows how biodiversity, like other complex environmental issues, can only be understood through the insights provided by many perspecives.

The very next week you find yourself in Kenya, treating wild animals. This is what happened to Dr. Jerry Haigh, who in Wrestling with Rhinos takes us deep into the post-independence Kenya of 1965, and shows us what things were like until he left ten years later for a teaching post in Canada. Dealing with a 17 foot tall lame giraffe was an early challenge, as there had not been many giraffes in the teaching pool at Glasgow. A fall back on common sense, with the help of the owner and a knowledge of cattle medicine helped to create a cure. Along the way, he encountered traditional domestic animal patients as well as rhinos, elephants, wildebeest, lemurs and pelicans. Among them was Joy Adamson's cheetah, and we get a first-hand glimpse of their Born Free experiences. While living in a country just making the transition from colonial status to independence, Jerry also met President Jomo Kenyatta and treated his cattle. Threaded through the text are observations -- sometimes hilarious, sometimes scurrilous, sometimes poignant -- on the social scene in Kenya, peppered with reminiscences about his soldier father, for whom the Kenya of World War II was a very different place.

The book by Alan M. Beck of Purdue's School of Veterinary Medicine and Aaron H. Katcher, psychiatrist and professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, explores the emotional and physical benefits of owning a pet and analyzes the complex relationship between people and pets. ""The study of the importance of the relationship between people and animals is a growing field and has the potential to be part of the whole human-health field,"" says Beck, director of Purdue's Center for Applied Ethology and Human-Animal Interaction. ""The social milieu on where animals fit into society has really changed in the last 13 years. We've gone from recognizing the potential of animals being a significant positive contribution to certain populations, such as the elderly, to actual documentation."" Beck and Katcher note a 1992 study by an Australian cardiologist of 5,000 people who visited a clinic to find ways to reduce heart disease. The study found that people with pets had lower blood pressure and lower blood fat levels than those without pets, even though the two groups were alike in diet and exercise. The authors also point to the trend by nursing homes to incorporate animals into the routine and environment for patients. For example, in the early 1980s nursing homes typically did not allow pets to visit patients, while today nearly half of the homes have an organized program for animal therapy, Beck says. In addition to exploring physical benefits, the book covers such topics as pets as family members, pets as therapists, talking to pets, and how pets can teach us to become better companions to friends and family. The book also has a list of Web sites by such organizations as Canine Companions for Independence and the American Kennel Club. While pets provide health benefits, they can create problems, Beck and Katcher say. ""There is no medicine that doesn't have some side effects,"" Beck says.

Working under the auspices of the Wildlife Conservation Society, his goal was to establish a wildlife research and conservation programme and to survey the country's wildlife.

According to the world famous astronomer David Levy, an eclipse of the Sun ""is a natural event with unnatural consequences. In fact a total eclipse of the Sun has the power to rip through to the core of your being."" Levy should know, having experienced the power of the vanishing Sun first as a child and most recently in August, 1999, on a ship in the North Atlantic. It was that voyage to the darkness of the disappearing Sun, followed by a rendezvous with a brilliant display of the Northern Lights, that formed the inspiration for this book Levy describes the experience of being shipboard on a calm and quiet sea, watching a crescent Sun rise above the waves at dawn. Seeing a crescent Moon rising in the night sky is a common and often beautiful experience. Seeing the Sun come up as a mere sliver of itself can fill the heart with dread. Just a mere twenty minutes passed from the beginning of the event to totality, but Levy reveals that the actual experience is so powerful it can be mind-altering.",128.0,184.0,25.4,,,,1.0,9780743407274,b&w halftones,34417f6c6a9928217802eea71a8498b1,full/6/1/a/61aa67f1f2157efca7f8be3c3674fdd3c45495a4.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/7434/9780743407274.jpg,ibooks Inc,,074340727X,9780743407274,en,2001-05-21 00:00:00,,4.5,2.0,Eclipse : Voyage to Darkness and Light,/Eclipse-David-H-Levy/9780743407274,204.0

Ironically, it has also been one of the most misunderstood and abused. Indeed, the rabbit is the only animal that our culture adores as a pet, idolizes as a storybook hero and slaughters for commercial purposes. Stories Rabbits Tell takes a comprehensive look at the rabbit as a wild animal, ancient symbol, pop culture icon, commercial ""product"" and domesticated pet. In so doing, the book explores how one species can be simultaneously adored as a symbol of childhood (think Peter Rabbit), revered as a symbol of female sexuality (e.g., Playboy Bunnies), dismissed as a ""dumb bunny"" in domesticity and loathed as a pest in the wild. The authors counter these stereotypes with engaging analyses of real rabbit behavior, drawn both from the authors' own experience and from academic studies, and place those behaviors in the context of current debates about animal consciousness. In a detailed investigative section, the authors also describe conditions in the rabbit meat, fur, pet and vivisection industries, and raise important questions about the ethics of treating rabbits as we do. The first book of its kind, Stories Rabbits Tell provides invaluable information and insight into the life and history of an animal whom many love, but whom most of us barely know. As such, it is a key addition to the current thinking on animal emotions, intelligences and welfare, and the way that human perceptions influence the treatment of individual species.",152.0,229.0,25.0,,New,,1.0,9781590560440,,22560bc71b8ca313a01f78d5b440b28c,full/b/f/c/bfc9b5874e911717ba3f01caeec52d07fa6c0c26.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5905/9781590560440.jpg,,,1590560442,9781590560440,en,2004-08-18 00:00:00,,4.28,193.0,Stories Rabbits Tell : A Natural and Cultural History of a Misunderstood Creature,/Stories-Rabbits-Tell-Susan-E-Davis/9781590560440,589.67

Communication is the crucial ingrediant in any relationship, especially when one of you happens to be a dog. Are you effectively expressing yourself to your hound? What about the other way around, are you catching his drift? Heady questions, to be sure. In HOW TO SPEAK DOG, renowned canine-psychology guru Stanley Coren provides all dog owners with a complete set of tools and skills for improving their relations with their pet. This ground breaking bok, the first to focus on the reciprocal nature of human-dog communications, goes well beyond the giving and obeying of commands. Demonstrating that the average house dog can differentiate up to 140 words, Coren explores the limits of a dog's language abilities and charts the possibilities.

But his white-hot ascent into the intellectual stratosphere drastically changed course when Nash's intuitive brilliance was undermined by schizophrenia. Facing challenges that have destroyed many others, Nash fought back, with the help of his devoted wife Alicia. After decades of hardship, he triumphed over tragedy, and received the Nobel Prize in 1994. A living legend, Nash continues to pursue his work today. Directed by Ron Howard and produced by Brian Grazer, this Universal and DreamWorks production stars Russell Crowe as John Nash.

Basing his ideas on common sense, Eco shares a vast wealth of literary and historical knowledge, touching on issues that affect us every day. At once philosophical and amusing, Kant and the Platypus is a tour of the world of our senses, told by a master of knowing what is real and what is not.",136.0,203.0,31.0,,New,,1.0,9780156011594,,0527469de3e8cdb55b424be18aa41553,full/7/e/0/7e00a50511529f0a7d0d17eebafd2eab759c87dc.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/1560/9780156011594.jpg,Wadsworth Publishing Co Inc,,015601159X,9780156011594,en,2000-11-09 00:00:00,,3.8,988.0,Kant and the Platypus : Essays on Language and Cognition,/Kant-Platypus-Professor-Semiotics-Umberto-Eco/9780156011594,517.0

Er greift darin die Thematik des Mitleids auf, deren falsche Form den jungen Leutnant Anton Hofmiller in einen Konflikt bringt. Edith von Kekesfalva, ein siebzehnjähriges gelähmtes Mädchen verliebt sich in ihn, ohne daß er ihr Gefühl erwidern kann. Doch ihre Zuneigung schmeichelt ihm. Der Arzt des Mädchens, dem deutlich wird, daß nur ""das schwachmütige und sentimentale Mitleid, das eigentlich nur Ungeduld des Herzens ist"", den Leutnant bewegt, fordert seinerseits nun von ihm das ""andere, das einzig zählt - das schöpferische Mitleid, das weiß, was es will und entschlossen ist, alles durchzustehen bis zum Letzten"". Anton Hofmiller glaubt formal und äußerlich der Verlobung zu genügen, ist aber unfähig, Edith auch nur einen einzigen Schritt wirklich entgegenzugehen, ja er streitet seinen Kameraden gegenüber sogar diese Verbindung ab. Sein Schuldbewußtsein erwacht sofort, aber erst allmählich wird er bereit, Verantwortung zu tragen. Doch unglückliche Umstände lassen Edith erfahren, daß er sie verleugnet hat - da stürzt sie sich vom Turm.

Jahrhundert - eine literarische Form, die mit der klassizistischen Auffassung und Tragödie bricht und Probleme des häuslich-privaten Bereichs und den Konflikt der Stände zum Gegenstand der tragischen Handlung macht. In sehr direkter Weise wird in Schillers 'Kabale und Liebe' mit seinem auf Spannung angelegten klaren Aufbau Kritik an den politischen Zuständen in der Fürstentümern geübt: Willkür, Mätressenwirtschaft, Verkauf von Landeskindern. Das bürgerliche Trauerspiel kontrastiert die verrottete Moral des Hofes mit der Tugend des Bürgertums. Im Mittelpunkt des Sturm-und-Drang-Stücks steht die tragische Liebesbeziehung zwischen Angehörigen verschiedener Stände: zwischen dem Adligen Ferdinand und der Musikertochter Luise Miller.

The introduction describes the decadent gardening ethos thus: 'In the garden, the decadent seeks to create a moment of beauty, which should be allowed to fall into decay and ruin.'Gardening, Lucan and Gray believe, is 'little more than systematic violence in pursuit of beauty', and the gardener is first and foremost a sadist. These two, the Kropotkin and De Sade of horticulture, understand that'nowhere are sex and death more intimately bound together than in the garden.' For them the garden is a place of 'agony, self-doubt and betrayal.' They remind us that, if we are to believe the Bible - not that they would be inclined to - the first murder was carried out by a gardener.And the first garden was a place where sin beckoned wherever you turned.The book abounds with piercing, pricking truths.The flower, they remind us, for example, is nothing but a sexual organ.The Decadent Garden consists of the plans for a series of thematic gardens that Lucan and Gray had conceived for a wealthy patroness. Each garden would symbolise an aspect of nature as they saw it. The Cruel Garden would consist largely of impenetrable thickets of thorns.The Fatal Garden would contain only representatives of the vegetable world's many poisonous denizens: among them, black bryony, dropwort and, of course, deadly nightshade.In the Narcotic Garden, by the side of the opium poppy and cannabis sativa, would grow more obscure mind-altering plants such as mandrake, henbane and thornapple. The Priapic Garden would be populated by those species whose flowers and foliage assumed the most suggestive phallic and vulvic shapes.Their Torture Garden carried the libertine ideas of Lucan and Gray furthest and is perhaps best left to the reader's imagination.Because Lucan and Gray barely realised their designs(they were too decadent to bother), their gardens flourish mainly in the mind.""",127.0,198.37,14.99,New edition,New edition,,1.0,9781873982822,34ill.,3a76e3462e8fdbbb5be023fb4301a48a,full/8/c/4/8c4d43d563238ad4a3e9784d3aff4c63387abaf3.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8739/9781873982822.jpg,,,1873982828,9781873982822,en,1998-02-01 00:00:00,,4.03,30.0,Decadent Gardener,/Decadent-Gardener-Medlar-Lucan/9781873982822,299.37

You've probably been dieting and exercising--or trying to--your entire life. You lose the weight; you gain it back. Or you lose most of the weight, but can't get those last stubborn 5 to 10 pounds to budge an inch. Or you exercise like mad, but still, the butt's a little saggy, the arm's a little flabby, and the belly's a little droopy. Why don't you have the body you always wanted? You may not know the real secrets of strength training and the magic of dumbbells. Judith Sherman-Wolin, exercise specialist at the UCLA Center for Nutrition, has developed a fast and easy dumbbell program that you can do at home and set up for less than it costs to go to a gym every month. You won't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger (who wants to anyway?) but you will watch your butt shrink, your abs flatten, and your arm muscles lengthen and firm.
